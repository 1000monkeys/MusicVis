Bottles getting low, bodies getting high
In the neon lights and the pink sky
I don't even know where you've been before
But I'll make it like it's your first time, your first time

Cause you've got something bright
In those dark eyes
Mess me up, just please
Don't apologize

I like it extreme, even more than you like it in your dreams
So just take me, take me to extremes
Only you know exactly what I mean
So just take me, take me

And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know
Baby take me to extremes
Only you, only you, only you know
And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know
Baby take me to extremes
Only you, only you, only you know

Bottles getting low, bodies getting high
In the neon lights and the pink sky
I don't even know where you've been before
But I'll make it like it's your first time, your first time

Cause you've  got something bright
In those dark eyes
Mess me up just please
Don't apologize

I like it extreme even more than you like it in your dreams
So just take me, take me to extremes
Only you know exactly what I mean
So just take me, take me

And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know
Baby take me to extremes
Only you, only you, only you know
And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know
Baby take me to extremes

Cause you've  got something bright
In those dark eyes
Mess me up just please
Don't apologize

I like it extreme even more than you like it in your dreams
So just take me, take me to extremes
Only you know exactly what I mean
So just take me, take me
