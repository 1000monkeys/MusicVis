I dreamt about you the other night
Stay with me today
The sun was warm
It carressed my skin
It wouldn't go away

Infrared light, smooth light, just right
Infrared light, smooth light, just right

Yeah you, laid me in that glow
Yeah you, you came to my lips
Yeah you, laid me in that glow
Yeah you, you came to my lips
Yeah you, laid me in that glow
Yeah you, you came to my lips
Yeah you, laid me in that glow
Yeah you, you came to my lips

We sat still in the perfect light
And watched the sun go down
It faded into an endless line
As my thoughts swirled around

Infrared light, smooth light, just right
Infrared light, smooth light, just right

Yeah you, 
I saw myself when the light caught your eye
Laid me in that glow, yeah you
I felt myself when you touched me like the sunrise
You came to my lips, yeah you
I sensed myself in the way that you looked at me
Laid me in that glow, yeah you
I love myself cause you saw into my-
You came to my lips

Yeah you, laid me in that glow
Yeah you, you came to my lips
Yeah you, laid me in that glow
Yeah you, you came to my lips

Yeah you
Yeah you
You came to my lips
Yeah you
