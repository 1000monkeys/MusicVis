(Na, na, na, na)
(We will never die)
(Na, na, na, na)
My own little world

Mutual sight, mutual sound
Mutual struggle for shared ground
(It's safe to say, they'll try to take from me)
I'm just another one for them to break down

Steeped in denial, oh the daily grind
Dream of a world for me and my kind
(It's safe in the alternate reality)
So stick your standards where the sun doesn't shine

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
Promise the world then take it from you anyway
They'll break you down, making your vision fade away
It's time to go! (Get outta my space!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here, I will never die

(My own little world)
My own little world
(My own little world)
My own little world
(My own little world)

Explain the reasons, explain the rhymes
It's not required, inside our minds
(It's safe to try, no need to justify)
Or take their guilt trip at the end of the line

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
Promise the world then take the universe away
They'll break you down, making your vision fade away
It's time to go! (Get off of my case!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here
Slip into a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Come with me into it and you know what you will find
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die

(Our own little world)
Our own little world
(Our own little world)
Our own little world
(Our own little world)

(Na, na, na, na) (We will never die)
(Na, na, na, na) (Na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na) (Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na) (Na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na) (Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, ooh)
My own little world
My own little world
My own little world

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
It's time to go! (Get outta my face!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here
Slip into a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Come with me into it and you know what you will find
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die

(Our own little world)
Our own little world
(Our own little world)
Our own little world
(Our own little world)
We will never die
