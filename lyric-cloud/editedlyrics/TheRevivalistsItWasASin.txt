I believe it was a sin
Oh to do you in the way I did
I stole the gold and drank the gin
Then I ran off with your kin
If I can you know I will and if the stars align
I still get loaded on the things that I can't change
And I'm out here tonight so if you want to start a fight
We'll get loaded on the things that I can't change
I believe it was a sin do you in the way I did you in
I couldn't stop it coming from afar
I lost the keys to the getaway car
And every now and then I'm in this place
It's hell living when I need your face
Don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
I believe it was a sin
Oh to do you in the way I did
I took out more than I put in
I got fat while you stayed thin
But I came here tonight if you want to start a fight
We can get loaded on the things that I can't change
Yeah I'm out here all night so if you want to start a fight
We can get loaded on the things that I can't change
I believe it was a sin
To do you in the way I did you in
I couldn't stop it coming from afar
And lost the keys to the getaway car
Every now and then I'm in this place
It's hell living when I need your face
Don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
Don't hide don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
Don't hide don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
Don't hide don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
Don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
I believe it was a sin
To do you in the way I did you in
I couldn't stop it coming from afar
And lost the keys to the getaway car
Every now and then I'm in this place
It's hell living when I need your face
Don't hide don't hide don't hide from me
Don't hide don't hide your face
Don't hide
Don't hide
Don't hide
