Here I am, tied and bound
Every night feeling low
Bad days come back, whatever
(Comes back, whatever)
In the sun I bathe, in everyday light
You draft me down for a split-second tomorrow 
What am I supposed to do?

I know you would make me happy
Girl, I found my way out
I found it at last, now I'm sober
Ooh, woo-ooh-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh

Let's go! Hey!
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh)
Let's go! Hey!
You're cryin', how-a sweet the sound

Silence on, I attempt
Bow and scrape, toe the line
Never get back together (Get back together)
With the same old style ran down my life
You drag and drop, attract me after all
Anyway, I'm gone tomorrow

I know you would make me happy
Girl, I found my way out
I found it at last, now I'm sober
 I know it would make it concrete
Now you're crying
Ooh, woo-ooh-ooh, how-a sweet the sound

Let's go! Hey!
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh)
Let's go! Hey!
You're cryin', how-a sweet the sound
Let's go!
Everybody, let's go!
Hey!
Let's go!

Been back-to-back for hours
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh)
We'll weaken what they say
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh)
Mmm, about lovin' like we do
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh)
We'd never give this up
(You're cryin', how sweet the sound)
