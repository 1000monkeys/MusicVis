The sky is falling
Human race that we run
Has left me crawling
Staring straight at the sun
Oh, in a moment I notice
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to hate

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
It's a waste of time

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I wanted something
Nothing blank I don't know
It's all deflecting
Stones are easy to throw
Oh, in a moment I've noticed
Hours, days left behind
Of wasted, useless
Selfless, none of a kind

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
Not to go back to the low

That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my...

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling


Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
