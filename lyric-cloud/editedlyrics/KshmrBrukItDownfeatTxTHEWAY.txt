I can't live this way
Marking off my days left on the wall
We don't know the way
But we march on, yeah, we march on
One day I'll be free
'Cause I know every king was once a pawn
We're out in the streets
We march on, yeah, we march on

We are stronger than what they say
Pushing harder
We don't break down, we break it down
And we are fire, you don't want that flame
Burning brighter

We don't break down, we bruk it down

Bruk it, bruk it down

We do not obey
Your authority (oh, nah, nah, nah)
Spit right in our face
But we march on, yeah, we march on
To our victory, through rubble and concrete
'Til shoes fall off our feet, yeah, we march on
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

We are stronger than what they say
Pushing harder
We don't break down, we break it down
And we are fire, you don't want that flame
Burning brighter

We don't break down, we bruk it down
Bruk it down

Bruk it, bruk it down
