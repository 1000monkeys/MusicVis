And when the heat is gone
And the fire is out
And a breeze of cold
Air is surrounding all
When the fools at heart
Fall in truth apart
Stay in lies together

And when the greed is growing
And we're finding out
Who to lay on
Where to fight it out
How our days were strong
When we spoke as one
Now we mime together

So now we've been around
And we've seen it all
Steady breathing in
And we scream it out
Then we're doing it all over
We hug it out
And we cry together

But as the haze cleared up
And our eyes see all
Then we'll chew it up
Just to spit it out
So you wanted it all
Well you got my bones
For you to hide forever

We're doing it all over
We're doing it all again
We're doing it all over
We're doing it all again
We're doing it all over
We're doing it all again
We're doing it all over
We're doing it all again
We're doing it all over
We're doing it all again
We're doing it all over
We're doing it all again

And when the heat is gone
Then we're better hide
In the weekend homes
That we're burning down
Let the flames all grow
Let us breathe the smoke
Till we die together
And then we'll see it
