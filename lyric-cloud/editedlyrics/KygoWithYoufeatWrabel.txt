Sitting at a bar with some friends
Telling them the things that you said
Left me with my heart in no hands
Told me we'd be better just friends
Staring at a television
Something 'bout the world's gonna end

I think about you
You think about me too

If we're losing our minds
I'd get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you

I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you

I've been seeing tears all morning
Feel like my apartment's flooding
I don't even know where we left it
Maybe I just need to take a shower
Washing off the last ten hours
All I smell is coffee and cigarettes and you

I'm thinking about you
You think about me too

If we're losing our minds
I'd get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you

I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you

Thinking about you

If we're losing in my minds
I'd get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you

I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you
