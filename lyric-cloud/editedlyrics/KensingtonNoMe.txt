There, I'm all alone again
And it seems as though it's never been so bleak
With the prize still in my hands
I'm led away towards a fate I cannot flee
Broke a bargain on my end
To redefine cut all the ties that incomplete me

Turn around I know the winds there
And I was blind for all the sights I could have seen
And the crown that I might get there
Won't prevail against the wall that I can't breach
Take the reins now in my stead
I'll move away from al the eyes that cannot see me now
See me now

Hear the raging in my past
Hear the rising of my breath
Far away as the the veil is nearing death and I'll grieve
But the fire is lit again, it's slowly burning me within
All the way, as the scene is nearly set, and I'll see
Butterflies, that are aching me inside
Through the veins, as they cut out all the mess and they won't rest till I bleed

Then I'm all alone again
And it seems as though it's never been so sweet
Let me write it all by hand
And I'll be the one I'm told I cannot be
All the roads that are ahead
Lead away from all the arms that cannot reach me now
Reach me now

See the fading of the past
The unwinding of the thread
It was all above me
Right above my head
Now it's pouring on me
It's dawning on me
That everything that's golden
Is buried deep in ground eroded
Now start digging there where all the lines meet

When the light has gone away
When the light has gone away
Not afraid
Not afraid
Not afraid
Of the dark
And the rise we're on will be
And the rise we're on will be
All the same
All the same
All the same
As the fall
And the signs went up again
And the signs went up again
Don't be late
Don't be late
Don't be late
To the door
Or the ride will never end
Or the fight will never end

Gone around
Wasted years to get it
Now throw away my only friends
Form a line
They make you pay to get in
My god
Gone around
Wasted years to get it
Now throw away my only friends
Form a line
They make you pay to get in
My god
Am I too late?

I'm not my father nor my cares
I'm not my body
There is no me
(Get it now)
I'm not my father nor my cares
I'm not my body
There is no me
(Get it now)
I'm not my father nor my cares
I'm not my body
There is no me
(Get it now)
I'm not my father nor my cares
I'm not my body
There is no me
But you will know me brother
Know me brother

And the price went up again
And the price went up again
Buy the weight
Buy the weight
Buy the weight
On your heart
And the body that we're in
And the body that we're in
Not awake
Not awake
Not awake
But not dead
And the foes we're up against
And the foes we're up against
Are not there
Are not there
Only there in our head
Are not there
Are not there
Only there in our head
Are not there
Are not there
Only there in our head
Are not there
Are not there
Only there in our head
Are not there
Are not there
Are not there
Are not there
