Don't be afraid love
Don't be afraid, my love

Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Don't be afraid love

When you're numb to the touch
You cannot chase this ghost away
And this too shall pass, this too shall pass
It won't always be the same
And every single scar that you claim
Is a stone in the path to this place
And every single choice that you make
Has led you this way so lay your head on me

Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Don't be afraid love
Don't be afraid love

And I can see it in your eyes, love
And your secret is not safe with me
You can spin through the night with your powdered mind
But don't cover up your scars for me
And every single choice that you make
Is a stone in the path to this place
And every single cut that you claim
Has led you this way

Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
Don’t be afraid love

It's okay, it's alright
It's okay, it's alright
Don't be afraid, love
It's okay, it's alright
It's okay, it's alright
Love
Don't be afraid
Love, don't be afraid
Lay your head on me
Love, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, love
