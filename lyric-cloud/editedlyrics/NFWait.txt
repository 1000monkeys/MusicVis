Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?
Why you leavin'?
(Wait)
I can't lose you, I can't lose you
Girl, I need you
Girl, I need you
(Wait)
And don't you love me? (Don't you love me?) Don't you love me?
Guess you don't want me, you don't want me
(Wait)
We back and forth, yeah, this ain't workin', this ain't workin'
Love ain't perfect, love ain't perfect

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you goin'? (Where you goin'?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
'Cause I just can't let go

Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait, wait (wait)
What you thinkin'? What you thinkin'?
Where's your mind at?
(Wait)
Don't you miss us, don't you miss us?
'Cause you don't call back, you don't call back
(Wait)
Are you happy? Tell me, are you happy?
Are you smilin'? Are you smilin'?
(Wait)
Girl, what happened? Tell me, girl, what happened?
'Cause I am dyin', I am dyin'

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you goin'? (Where you goin'?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
'Cause I just can't let go
(Wait)

We don't wanna have a conversation
We don't wanna think about it, we just wanna fake it
We just wanna act like everything is great
Go back to the day watchin' movies in the basement
And the problem is now I'm feeling like everything is changed
And I'm trying to make a livin' on the music
But I feel like every time I look at you I'm in a place
It's hard to be the man of the house when you ain't got a house (I hate this)
(Yeah) It's complicated, it's complicated
We don't wanna talk (We don't wanna talk)
It's complicated
I'm sitting in the hotel room like, "Why?"
I call your phone and apologize
There's gotta be a way we can make this right
We can make this right

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you goin'? (Where you goin'?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
'Cause I just can't let go

I'm holding onto pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
(W-wait)
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
