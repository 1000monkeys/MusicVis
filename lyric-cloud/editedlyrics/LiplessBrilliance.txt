Dancing through the storm, walking down an open road
Cold but I am warm
Hold you in my arms, keep you safe from what you know
Wild but I am calm

Not about lust, I'm over that
Not about money
Who do we trust? No turning back
You're all that I need, all that I need

Neon lights and the radio
Driving through the unknown distance
I look in your eyes and now I know
We are a different form of brilliance

Where you wanna go, find a place that no one knows
Through the sand and snow
Open up your heart, let me take you as you are
Underneath the stars

Not about drugs, I'm more than that
Not about money
All about us, no turning back
You're all that I need, all that I need

Neon lights and the radio
Driving through the unknown distance
I look in your eyes and now I know
We are a different form of brilliance
Neon lights and the radio
Driving through the unknown distance
I look in your eyes and now I know
We are a different form of brilliance
