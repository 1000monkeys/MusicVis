Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me

God I feel like I'm locked tight
Tied up like a beast with a bad bite
Yeah I knew you were wrong but you felt right
Good thing I didn't lay it down tonight
Cause I wanted to apologize but boy you fed me lies now I'm thinking that I rolled the dice
Now it's too late to gain your trust, control your lust, no baby that's dangerous

What does it take to find me the man who won't go and break my heart?
There's only one and he's got the key
But we are two worlds apart

Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me

Shoulda told you to run along
Shoulda backed down when I saw you coming on strong
But time is gone
Attempt to rewind your past but you'll find that can't be done
But I fell for those eyes, they took me by surprise
I shoulda never ever compromised
But it's too late
You broke in, no warning
And now all that I got is my heartbeat

What does it take to find me the man who won't go and break my heart?
There's only one and he's got the key
But we are two worlds apart

Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me

What does it take to find me the man who won't go and break my heart?
There's only one and he's got the key
But we are two worlds apart

Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me
Yeah... for me
