Just like the street lights lit this town
Like a fire in a blaze, gotta burn it down
Can't be afraid to live this out
We got this far don't know how

I see danger in your eyes
They know we'll burn down the night
Coming just like the sunrise
You know that we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Just like the sunrise, we gonna light it up
Now

Light it up, light it up
We light it, light it up

Just like a spark that's breaking out
Can't make it stop, can't turn back now
We know that's there no room for doubt
No we can't turn back now

I see danger in your eyes
They know we'll burn down the night
Coming just like the sunrise
You know that we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Just like the sunrise, we gonna light it up
Now
