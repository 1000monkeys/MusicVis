I don't wanna go to bed
I got the virus in my head
My dreams, feel alive
I don't care if it's just in my mind

I don't wanna go to bed
I got the virus in my head
My dreams, feel alive
I don't care if it's just in my mind

Feel alive, feel alive
All my dreams, they feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
All my dreams, they feel alive
(Feel alive)

I don't wanna go to bed
I got the virus in my head
My dreams, feel alive
I don't care if it's just in my mind

I don't wanna go to bed
I got the virus in my head
My dreams, feel alive
I don't care if it's just in my mind

Feel alive, feel alive
All my dreams, they feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
All my dreams, they feel alive
(Feel alive)
