Break me in, don't break me down
Swimming in these empty towns
I wonder if it's all some master plan
Diving into sweeter bliss
Falling further before we miss
Taste the taste before it's gone and you're too late

Won't change what I am to find who you are
Can't stay in these lines when I'm bursting at the seams
My body might collapse if I carry one more dream
If I carry one more dream, I could be anything
I could be anything

Dipping out beyond the night
Reeling in the quieter times
Saving all the flavors of my mind
Reflecting on the lessons learned
The broken bonds and bridges burned
Take the taste of hate and throw it away

Won't change what I am to find who you are
Can't stay in these lines when I'm bursting at the seams
My body might collapse if I carry one more dream
If I carry one more dream, I could be anything
I could be anything
