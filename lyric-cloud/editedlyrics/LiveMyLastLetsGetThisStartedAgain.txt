Throw your hands up and fill the next cup
Let's get this started again, again, again, again

Wake up, rub the eyes
It's another new day and it's no surprise
I lost my phone, my keys, my car
I left my wallet at the bar
Tie shoes, swig some booze
Another new day
Got nothing to lose
I can't remember her name
I think the shots are to blame

If it's only gonna be for tonight
Let's set this party right

So throw your hands up
And fill the next cup
Let's get this started again
Me and my whole crew
We live with no rules
Let's get this started again
Let's get this started again

Go time, check the clock
Grab beer, take a couple of shots
Throw on my favorite song
Raise up my glass and sing along
Let's dance, no delays
This party's on the way
She's feeling frisky, we're both tipsy
And she's ready to play

If it's only gonna be for tonight
Let's set this party right

So throw your hands up
And fill the next cup
Let's get this started again, again
Me and my whole crew
We live with no rules
Let's get this started again, again

So if you feel like me too
There's only one thing to do (let's go!)
Pay tab, call the taxi cab
Got a case in the fridge and a bottle at the crib
Let's all get twisted, double fisting
Drink up, no resisting
Let's get this started again
Let's get this started again

Last call for alcohol
Let's drink 'til we have to crawl
It's just a matter of time
Before we lose our minds

If it's only gonna be for tonight
Let's set this party right

So throw your hands up
And fill the next cup
Let's get this started again (again, again, again)
Me and my whole crew
We live with no rules
Let's get this started again

So if you feel like me too
There's only one thing to do (let's go!)
Pay tab, call the taxi cab
Got a case in the fridge and a bottle at the crib
Let's all get twisted, double fisting
Drink up, no resisting
Let's get this started again
Let's get this started again

Let's get this started again
