Wisdom, like water, runs down to my feet
The more that you tell me, the less I can sleep
Time is a weapon that takes every man
Oh let me be young, I won't understand

Rise up like smoke, let the air choke
Mountains crumbling down, oh let them go
Rise up the sea, oh let me be
And let the waves crash over me
(And let the waves crash over me)
(And let the waves crash over me)

Let go of reasons, surrender to fate
The apple of Eden is all yours to taste
Nobody's perfect and things will be rough
Love conquers all, so let there be love

Rise up like smoke, let the air choke
Mountains crumbling down, oh let them go
Rise up the sea, oh, let me be
Rise up the sea, oh, let me be
And let the waves crash over me
Rise up the sea, oh, let me be
And let the waves crash over me
Rise up the sea, oh, let me be
And let the waves crash over me
