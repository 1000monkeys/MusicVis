And I feel alive
After all this time
I'm awake, awake, astray
I can see clearly now
And I will survive
Mixing all these lies
I'm awake, awake, I'm proud
Giving my hardest try

Flying, flying
When I'm, when I'm high
So supersonic
Flying, flying
I don't need no guy

So supersonic (x4)
So supersonic -onic
Su- supersonic (x4)

And I feel alive
After all this time
I'm awake, awake, astray
I can see clearly now
And I will survive
Mixing all these lies
I'm awake, awake, I'm proud
Giving my hardest try

Flying, flying
When I'm, when I'm high
So supersonic
Flying, flying
I don't need no guy

So supersonic (x4)
So supersonic -onic
Su- supersonic (x4)
Flying, flying
When I'm, when I'm high
So supersonic
Flying, flying
I don't need no guy
So supersonic
