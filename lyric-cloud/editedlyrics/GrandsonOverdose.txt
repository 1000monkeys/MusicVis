I was higher than the nosebleed, I
Turn up till my nose bleed, I
Blacked out in the black car, I
Was trying to feel like a rockstar, but
I can't just do one now, no
I've been way too numb now
I'm living on the run now
Oh I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the drugs don't work

Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

I couldn't find the fill again, I
Couldn't seem to kill the pain, I
Was living in the moment
Searching for a little serotonin
But, this shit ain't so fun now, I
Can't tell what the comedown, I
Been living on the run now
Oh I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the drugs don't work

Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

There is no need for anyone to suffer in pain anymore

Woo, woo, woo, woo
Overdose, overdose, overdose
Overdose, overdose, overdose
All fun and games till I hit the floor comatose

Overdose, all fun and games till I hit the floor comatose
Overdose
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Overdose, all fun and games till I hit the floor comatose
Overdose!
