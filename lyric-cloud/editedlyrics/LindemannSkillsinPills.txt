If you want to die
Or if you want to chill
Even if you want to get high
Whatever happens, take a pill
The first I take against depression
The second is pure energy
The green one for my self-agression
Then the red one, ectasy
Ecstasy, -sy, -sy, -sy

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast was slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All the, all the rain is sun
Skills in pills

If the jag gets really strong
A pink one goes with booze and blow
So I keep fucking all night long
The orange is for... I don't know
The grey one for my perfect sleep
Yellow for my needful cure
The blue one keeps my boner steep
I take two, just to be sure

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast was slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All the, all the rain is sun

Skills in pills
Skills in pills
Skills in pills
Skills in pills

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast was slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All the, all the rain is sun

The white one
For my, whatever pain
In the end I start to cry
So I take the first again
I have a last one
And I hope to die
