Doesn't take much to feel the rush
With nothing but your eyes on me
How 'bout we do just like we do
Two crazy fools just breaking free

No, it don't matter what we've been told
I can see the skies are gold
Yeah, it's just you and me and open road, let's go

I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight, I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway
I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight, I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway tonight

It's getting dark, let's light a spark
Ignite our hearts and burn away
This is our time, it's do or die
Come on, let's rise for heaven's sake

Oh, it don't matter what we've been told
I can see the skies are gold
Yeah, it's just you and me and open road, let's go

I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight, I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway
I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight, I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway tonight
