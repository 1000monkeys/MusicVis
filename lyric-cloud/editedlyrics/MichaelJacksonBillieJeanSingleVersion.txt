She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She said I am the one
Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. People always told me
Be careful of what you do. And don’t go around
Breaking young girls' hearts. And mother always told me
Be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do
Cause the lie becomes the truth. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she’s in demand
Her schemes and plans. Go dance on
On the floor
In the round. So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(do think twice)
She told my baby
We'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
His eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
Go dance
On the floor
In the round
People always told me
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around
Breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son. She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
