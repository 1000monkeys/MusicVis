Psycho by Post Malone ft. Ty Dolla $ign
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
Roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
Roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
Made my first million, I'm like, "Damn, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had every slit, ayy
And I had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we could send in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds weigh, my teeths is sore
I got homies, let it blow, oh
God's Plan by Drake
She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there’d be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies, oh
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, on my own
Someone watchin' this is close, this is close
I've been me since Scarlett Road
Look Alive by BlocBoy JB ft. Drake
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive
Yeah they came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, forget 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside and then I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, so I did actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, so I did actin' like I died
Mixed
Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
