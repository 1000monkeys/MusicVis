Check me out, turn my music up, yeah
One–two, yeah, one–two, uh, yeah
Check me out, yeah

A militant, Mr. Green ready to pull your card
No my name ain't Roosevelt but I'm upon your boulevard
First a nigga ride up with the product
I'm known to blow the skies up, tell ya ma' "duck"
When I rise up chicks put they thighs up
Play hard, work a little, build the enterprise up
Get the measurement and niggas I can size up
Style way foul, like the owl you better wise up
I play this game of life like it was an instrument
But sometimes I still find myself in 'em predicaments
Monkey on my back, I gotta build an almanac
I got the solution, they can show me where the problem at
If a joker's loco – put him in a choke hold
Show that motherfucker how you're known to let the smoke fold
You gotta understand, the joker, he's in joke mode
Brain soaked in this thang, cloaked by the boat load
I got a dope though, period and yoko
Give me that perspective, Malcolm X and the popo
Philly resident, the drama's always evident
Suckers not in my job, description's why I'm hesitant
I'm tryna make a meal, the Jus got me to take a deal
I don't know how a faker feel, show you how my fade is real

Everyone close to me
They can sense demons in my life
Save me from these dark streets
Guard me, bring me to the light

Let me tell you this, yo
I bring power to strength, bringing y'all to the length
When you see that fucking red dot on your chest, it's the end
Snatch you girl and mount her on my lap cause she's a nymph
When I aim and start to squeeze and buck, better duck
This soldier never budged, my soldier strut don't give a fuck
You hold a grudge, never got along with a judge
Every time I gotta sit and do a bid like a duck
Chicks setting niggas up when they bring home from the club
I'm connected with the Angel of Death, just waiting to die
Taking the pie, vacate, you're faking your high
After dark, don't get caught cause bullets fly
Clash, ring out, and bark, who's the first to get sparked?
You're nothing but talk, put your gear in neutral and park
Verbal assault, now you wanna run from the war, yo
(Motherfucker)

Everyone close to me
They can sense demons in my life
Save me from these dark streets
Guard me, bring me to the light

Yeah, yo
Since I was 12 my name ring bells in the boroughs of NY
Poetry, Poe, Pit and the Pendulum, where Rugged Man died
Dark streets accelerated heartbeats
Where the Christian God and the Muslim Allah meets
Liquor stores and the god priests
The God speech, more shook than Mobb Deep's
Crush, kill, conquer, the ET, sharper than sharks on shark week
I'm back - the no name, the slow brain wrecker
The propane, crack cocaine, gold chain era
Black cloak, cane, no shame, reign terror
You lames so plain, I'm John Coltrane better
Rappers are signing to Satan, this ain't a Beach Boy good vibration
It's a total lyrical annihilation
Finally forgettin' following the fakes you put your faith in
To the mentally dying I spit a rhyme and you awaken
Rappers exaggerating they petty claims
They shoot you in your back like the assassination of Jesse James
I'm the ultimate rhyme pro
With a Chuck D voice and a Daddy Kane flow and a KRS live show
Spit the sick tune, hit the fam with shit soon
Malik B, Mr. Green, another hit with Miss. Bruun, sing

Everyone close to me
They can sense demons in my life
Save me from these dark streets
Guard me, bring me to the light
