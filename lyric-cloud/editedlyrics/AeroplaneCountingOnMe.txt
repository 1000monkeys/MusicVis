Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me

I've been lying here for days
I'm alone and I don't know why
She's been staying someplace else
And I know there's another guy
And I know this far too long now darling
But you know I don't play them games
So can't you see where I am coming from
'Cause you know I can't walk away

Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me

I've been lying here for days
I'm alone and I don't know why
She's been staying someplace else
And I know there's another guy
And I know this far too long now darling
But you know I don't play them games
So can't you see where I am coming from
'Cause you know I can't walk away

Now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher than before
I said now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher than before
I said now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher than before
I said now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher, taking me higher
Your love is taking me higher
Your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher, your love is taking me higher
Your love, your love, your love is taking me higher
Your love, your love
Now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher than before
I said now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher than before
I said now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher than before
I said now your love is taking me higher
Taking me higher, taking me higher
I got to say your love, I got to say your love
There's something 'bout your love, taking me higher
I got to say your love, I got to say your love
There's something 'bout your love, taking me higher
I got to say your love, I got to say your love
There's something 'bout your love, taking me higher
I know that your love, I know that your love
Is taking me higher

Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me
Counting on me, counting on me
