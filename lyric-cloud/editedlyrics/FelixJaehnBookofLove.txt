In the midnight haze, we are sitting in the sun
The light hits your face and I know that you're the one
We could fill the pages with good dreams tonight
I wanna be a chapter in your book of love

In your book of love
In your book of love
In your, in your
In your book of love

Baby, we are flying too close to the sun
And we may get barren but it'd be a crime to run
Cause you're perfect as the deep blue sky above
You can be a chapter in my book of love

In my book of love
In my book of love
In my, in my
In my book of love

Eternity is our playground
Tell me if you wanna get high
Tell me if you wanna be down

In my book of love
In my book of love
In my, in my
In my book of love
Book of love
