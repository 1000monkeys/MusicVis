He says, "this is not a booty call
This is just a regular one
I am all alone, but I want to go out and have fun
And I know, if you come with me
We could turn the whole town up
We could fuck in the morning if you wanna girl
If not just say no"

How can I say no boy, how can I say no
How can I say no when I know you're all alone
That would just be rude
That would just be rude

That would just be rude
How can I say no boy, how can I say no
How can I say no when I know you're all alone
That would just be rude
That would just be rude

Now I'm up against the wall, all up on you boy, you can't run
A kaleidoscope of feelings, everybody's just here having fun
And I know, if I came with you
We would turn the whole town up
We will fuck in the morning and you want it boy
I know from your touch

How can you say no boy, how can you say no
How can you say no when you know we're all alone
That would just be rude
That would just be rude

Can you breathe us in the air
I just wanna heal you
I want it when I'm close to you
'Cause you're the only winner in here with me
Wondrous smile, we can still break free
I just wanna heal you, want it when I'm close to you

That would just be rude
How can you say no boy, how can you say no
How can you say no when you know we're all alone
That would just be rude
That would just be rude

That would just be rude
