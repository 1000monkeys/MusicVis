You talk a lot of shit
For somebody who’s sorry now
If I’m a habit that you miss
Take a hit, I’m euphoria
This is everything I wanna say
But can’t say yet
And everything I wanna change
But can’t change yeah
You’re looking for someone to blame
I won’t take it (I,I)

I gave you all my blood
At the start of this war
And even though you’re gone
Oh I’m still waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
And I gave you all my blood
At the start of this war
And even though you’re gone
Oh I’m still waiting for your love
Waiting for your love

Thanks for calling me
On my birthday
To say I was wrong
I hope you swallow me
When you’re in between
Your broken thoughts
This is everything I wanna say
But can’t say yet
And everything I wanna change
But can’t change yeah
You’re looking for someone to blame
I won’t take it, (I, I)

I gave you all my blood
At the start of this war
And even though you’re gone
Oh I’m still waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
And I gave you all my blood
At the start of this war
And even though you’re gone
Oh I’m still waiting for your love
Waiting for your love

I gave you all my blood
At the start of this war
And even though you’re gone
Oh I’m still waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
And I gave you all my blood
At the start of this war
And even though you’re gone
Oh I’m still waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
