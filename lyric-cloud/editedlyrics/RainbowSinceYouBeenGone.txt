I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Ohh, whoa, ohh
Since you been gone
So in the night I stand beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me
Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Ohh, whoa, ohh
Since you been gone
If you will come back
Baby, you know
You'll never do wrong, huh
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ever since you been gone
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Since you been gone, since you been gone
