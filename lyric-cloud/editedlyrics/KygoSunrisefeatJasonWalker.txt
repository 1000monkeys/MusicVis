Wake me up
My eyes are heavy and I need some sun
One hit, I'm ready for whatever comes
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you
Something 'bout the things you told me
Oh, I wrote 'em down, yeah
I took on with me to the place we found
And I'll be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you, for you

I follow the moon
From the dark to the break of dawn
We let it loose
Smoking weed and writing songs

Meet me at the sunrise, at the sunrise
I can get you so high, so high
Burning up the daylight, in the daylight
Meet me at the sunrise, sunrise

Call my name
'Cause I'm so lost and I don't know this place
And I got this feeling that I just can't shake
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you

I follow the moon
From the dark to the break of dawn
We let it loose
Smoking weed and writing songs

Meet me at the sunrise, at the sunrise
I can get you so high, so high
Burning up the daylight, in the daylight
Meet me at the sunrise, sunrise
