Don't even know, don’t even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don’t even know, don't even know
Don't even know

Do you still have those nightmares, baby?
Where you see me
You still tell yourself you hate me
Or believe it lately?
I know I'm still the villain in your story
You look me in the eyes like you don't even know me (You don't even know me)

Did it kill you, did it kill you?
But I was there too, I was there too
You look me in the eyes like you don't even know me (You don't even know me)
You don’t even know me

Still don’t know
(I do I do)
I still don't know
(I do I do)
I still don’t know
(I do I do)
I still don't know

You don't even know me

Still don't know
(I do I do)
I still don’t know
(I do I do)
Still don't know
(I do I do)
I still don't know
You don't even know me
Still don't know
(I do I do)
I still don't know
(I do I do)
Still don't know
(I do I do)
I still don't know
You don't even know me

Maybe I can't learn my lesson
The same intentions
I can't find that same connection
Do you remember?
I know I'm still the villain in your story
You look me in the eyes like you don't even know me (You don't even know me)
Did it kill you, did it kill you?
But I was there too, I was there too
You look me in the eyes like you don't even know me (You don't even know me)
You don't even know me

Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know
You don't even know

You don't even know, You don't even know
You don't even know, You don't even know
You don't even know, You don't even know
You don't even know, You don't even know

You don't even know me
Go!

Still don't know me
I still don't know
I do I do
Still don't know me
Oh I still don't know
You don't even know me

Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know, don't even know
Don't even know don't even know
