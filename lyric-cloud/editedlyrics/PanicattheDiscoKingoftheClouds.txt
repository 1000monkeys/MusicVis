Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

I keep searching
Oh, I keep searching
I keep searching
