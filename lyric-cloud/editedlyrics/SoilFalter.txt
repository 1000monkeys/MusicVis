End
Way
Falter
I haven't rendered this to anyone before
The book is open
And it's spilling on the floor
Comes once again
I'm buried in sin
All hope is gone
End
Way
Falter
Falling down again
End
Way
Falter
Feeling down again
Waves come crashing, everlasting
This amount of pain
Forever changing, anticipating
The same mistakes I've made
It comes once again
I'm buried in sin
All hope is gone
End
Way
Falter
Falling down again
End
Way
Falter
Feeling down again
Feeling down again
I'm feeling down again
End
Way
Falter
Falling down again
End
Way
Falter
Feeling down again
(I'm feeling down again)
End
Way
Falter
(I'm falling down)
Falling down again
(I'm falling down again)
