You're the one with the pretty little disposition
Colour me up, feeling the rush, oh
Like you'tr better when we alone, see the side of you that I love the most, yeah
From a kiss, to a touch, never have enough of
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh

We could talk all night, fits the words just right
As we lay among the silence and you see it now
The colours pour out, feeling bluer in the morning
But red comes when you're around

You're the one with the pretty little disposition
Colour me up, feeling the rush, oh
Like you'tr better when we alone, see the side of you that I love the most, yeah
From a kiss, to a touch, never have enough of
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh

Fuck the patience and the waiting
See I been looking round the city for somebody like you
Every avenue, learning the lingo
Now I'll be waking up next to you
Fuck the patience and the waiting
See I been looking round the city for somebody like you
Every avenue, learning the lingo
Now I'll be waking up next to you

You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one stuck in the rush, oh
