I have never wished on hope
Didn’t need a telescope to see where I am going
I have never been the one trying hard to hold my tongue
It’s my stereo and

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God, yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the King of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
I'll be the king of me

Born in a broken home, okay
Single momma let me chase what I was made for
We made out the paradise
Build on nickels, rubbing dimes
I'mma turn it to so much more

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the King of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah

I'll be the king of me, me, me
I'll be the king of me, me, me
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah

I have never wished on hope
Didn’t need a telescope to see where I am going
I have never been the one trying hard to hold my tongue
Is my stereo on
I wanna be like Kanye
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
I wanna be like Kanye

I'll be the king of me, me, me
I'll be the king of me, me, me
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
