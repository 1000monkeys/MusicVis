The longer we wait, the better we get
One other good day and I'll believe it
I want to be safe out here, unharmed forever
Instead I will bathe in fear, too fooled to get it

But I will warn you
That I've done this all before you
And I hoped I had it in me
But I just don't get it yet, no

Why let it in if I won't keep it?
Throw in a safe part of the flame and I will feed it
And if I knew how to play sincere, I swear I'd do it
But every trace of tears will turn my head again

And I will warn you
That I've done this all before you
And I hoped I had it in me
But I just don't get it yet
But I hope to
Cause I've seen this all before you
And I thought I had it in me
But I just don't get it yet, no

How did I end up here?
All I give is worn out phrases
Cold embraces
How did I end up here?
All I give is worn out phrases
Cold embraces

I will warn you
That I've done this all before you
And I hoped I had it in me
But I just don't get it yet
But I hope to
Cause I've seen this all before you
And I thought I had it in me
But I just don't get it yet, no
