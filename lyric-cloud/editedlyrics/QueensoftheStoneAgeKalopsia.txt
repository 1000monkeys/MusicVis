I never lie to myself tonight
Rose tinted eyes
Color my sorrow a shade of wine

Bye bye black balloon
See you real soon
Wave bye bye
(Bye bye)

Oh, why you so sad
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing God
Copy cats in cheap suits
Are playing it safe
While cannibals of bad news
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?
Kalopsia, kalopsia
Kalopsia
Kalopsia, Kalopsia

Far, far from shore
The land of nightmares, gone forever more
And I love you more than I can control
I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh why the long face?
You've got it all wrong
Forget the rat in the race
We'll choke chain them all
Fates favor the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they row (As they row)
The boat (The boat)
To Hell, to Hell

Row
