You know I want ya, sweet devotion
But we're going nowhere
You know I need it, like no other
Building a love affair

You make me high when I go low
And then you show me left, it's the right way to go
So if you take your time, we'll risk it all
Now that I'm ready for love (now that I'm ready for love)

You got me high on you
You got me high on you, oh yea-yeah
I know, you know we want the same
You got me going
You got me high on you
You got me high on you, oh yea-yeah
I know, you know we want the same
You got me going
You got me high on you
You got me high on, you got me high on
You got me high on, high on you
You got me high on, you got me high on
You got me high on, high on you

You are the fuel that keeps me running
Flying on liquid air
You are the reason my head is spinning
I see you everywhere

You make me high when I go low
And then you show me left, it's the right way to go
So if you take your time, we'll risk it all
Now that I'm ready for love (now that I'm ready for love)
(for love, for love, for love, for love)
(for love)

You got me high on you
You got me high on you (you got me high on you baby)
I know, you know we want the same
You got me going
You got me high on you (yeah)
You got me high on you (oh), oh yea-yeah
I know, you know we want the same
You got me going
You got me high on you
You got me high on, you got me high on
You got me high on, high on you
You got me high on, you got me high on
You got me high on, high on you
