Keep the love alive
Being with you
And this new sunrise is upon us
A new sunrise is all we need
New sunrise is upon us
A new sunrise is all we need

Holding for the break of day
Don't look back, it's all the same
So many hours to go
We can take our time now
We can take it slow
So many hours to go

Love through the night
I wanna love through the night
I wanna love through the night
I wanna love through the night
I wanna
