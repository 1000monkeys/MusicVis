You know God is in the rain
How else can you explain
How it takes away the pain
The sunshine puts a smile on us all
Makes the love in us call
Makes us want to feel it all
You know God is in the rain
How else can you explain
How it takes away the pain
The sunshine puts a smile on us all
Makes the love in us call
Makes us want to feel it all
