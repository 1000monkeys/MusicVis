Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Oh... thinking about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
There's lots that I could say
Cause our love will light the way
Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Now our dreams are coming true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you
