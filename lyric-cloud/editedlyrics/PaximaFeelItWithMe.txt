Where am i going, who's coming
Just sewing seeds I'm loving
The urge for a need, wait to succeed from nothing
Coz in the end we all got mouths to feed in this jungle
People talk, but their ideas they mumble
Grumble about where they live is crumbling
So we all stumble in to the local
And wonder why we ain't hopeful to go from there to global to mogul
Too aware of the so called, humanity out there, vanity beware, be wary
Look to the sky but why be shy, it's not scary
Why shadow in your shadow, why hide in disguise
These guys don't realise, just envision through your real eyes

While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)

Coz 
I'm just sitting here in my imagination, musical creation
Trying to be patient, yet
Still round and round i cycle, stuck
Should i look phelps like michael
I see a trip, that's insightful, a tight call, 
should i stick to the script
Or stop it all now like a bud and a nip
My zone comfortable, trouble is it's easy to sit still
Open up new areas like a white pill time fill
Imagine countries i can come, see, and conquer
Now that's hallucinations, where is my encore
A rhyme for a long tour, a detour on contours
Continued brain develops to envelop life's design
People's positives try to undermine, can't get under mine
It eats you up no wine no dine till you're bitesize, no gcse
Just get to the high rise and think with me

While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)

I'm just sitting here in my imagination
Under the sedation, blow up like inflation, but
I keep sitting here relaxing, even that involves tax
 and
Why everyone asking questions, where's the real Jeremy Paxman
Sitting here thinking is everyone like me
Supposedly living free in the q for the p
Where we queue miserably, school uni degree
Coz there's more to life than a b and c
Searching for who we are, or guessing who we'll be
I guess the new hide and seek should be called wait and see
And we'll never know y but we'll always be an x
On that dotted line, waiting to be next
Vexed, complex, dream your dreams
Who are we to leave them be
On false hopes, no reality
Sell out arena's, but not yourself
Even Katie has a price somewhere in the wealth

I got nothing to lose, does that mean i can win
Like an anorexia doctor, my patience is growing thin
But to start from nothing you only got shit to gain
When you obtain, you can lose, is that the price of fame
But there's loads of congestion on the road to the top
Walk or run but my only suggestion is hip-hop
We're like soil with plenty routes to take
Don't be scared to make a mistake
So we dream awake and think in our sleep
Many faulty steps in a hierarchy so steep
Swim away, many shallow people in a world so deep
Like a dotted line, I'm just waiting to be signed
But i got broken watch, will i ever get my time
No skater but i'll stay on my grind
Even do it in my sleep i should buy some braces
Just wanna see places full of happy faces
Embracing music coz it turns heads
As i pour my life into ink and lead
Don't be led to suppression over expression
Let it go, just press the impression, feel the flow

While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
While I'm sitting here (sitting here)
