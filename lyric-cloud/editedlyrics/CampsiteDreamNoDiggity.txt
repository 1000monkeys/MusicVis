Shorty get down, good lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
Can't get him out of my mind
I think about him all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, its not surprise
He got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
He's on when he's got to have it
Baby you're the perfect 10
I wanna get it
Can i get down, so i can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, got to bag it, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, got to bag it, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, got to bag it, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity

He's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Loves its curves so freak what you heard
Rolling with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang bang, and look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day everyday
You're blowing my mind
Maybe in time
Baby I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, got to bag it, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, got to bag it, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, got to bag it, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity
