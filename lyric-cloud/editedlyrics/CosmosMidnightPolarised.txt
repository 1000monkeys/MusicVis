I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like
I might have made a wrong turn
'Cause you're on my mind
I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like
This time I wish I could be first
'Cause you're on my mind
I'm paralyzed

I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like
I might have made a wrong turn
I'm paralyzed
I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like
I might have made a wrong turn
'Cause you're on my mind
And though you're right
I'm paralyzed

I'm so polarized

I could be anywhere in the world
You'll be floating in my head
Like a rendezvous, very late in the night
But you're not here with me
I just wanna cruise with you
I just wanna travel with you

I'm so polarized
I'm so polarized
