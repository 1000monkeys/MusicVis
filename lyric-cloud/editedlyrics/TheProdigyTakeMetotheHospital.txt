Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive

Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive

Along came a spider
He was creepy like Dracula
He spoke like he was a friend
So I bit with adrenaline
Hold it!
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive

Welcome to the scene of the crash

Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
