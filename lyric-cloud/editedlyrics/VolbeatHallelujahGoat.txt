One lucky bastard finds a way
For picking up a brand new fire rose
All the days of wine and pitiful lie
The pitiful rhymes were all a long time ago

That's the way it all will end
Die alone, you never will
Hell is here, unleash your tail

Well, the Lord above has never been on my side or your side
Hallelujah goat
Walking through the fire like a soldier
Kicking the door and kicking the devil's whore

That's the way it all will end
Die alone, you never will
Hell is here, unleash your

Heaven, where did you go?
People are searching, searching for love
So easy blaming the horned
Mankind the sinner
Forever it burns
