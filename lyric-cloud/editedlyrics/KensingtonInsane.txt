A seat on the stand
As you're causing a row
There to proof again that I am
Just there in both the wrong time and the wrong place

I plead innocent
But you're dragging me down
Down a road where I know I can't
Get time to raise up my guard for you, can't wait

Till I cave
It's not the words
Not the fear or the doubt
Not the lack of heart that takes me out
It's the knowing that you can't relate
When you're insane

Scenes of distress
They follow me around
Till I lose again and by then
You might be calm but my head will explode

I'm out of moves here
I swallow it down
Like a poison undefined that
Enters my veins like at thread that I can't shake

Till I cave
It's not the words
Not the fear or the doubt
Not the lack of heart that takes me out
It's the knowing that you can't relate
When you're insane
It's not the pain
Not the bruise or the scar
Not the lack of love that breaks me down
It's the knowing that you can't refrain
‘Cause you're insane

I know I wait too long
Before I will break a bond
I know my body froze
My greatest loss

It's not the words
Not the fear or the doubt
Not the lack of heart that takes me out
It's the knowing that you can't relate
When you're insane
It's not the pain
Not the bruise or the scar
Not the lack of love that breaks me down
It's the knowing that you can't refrain
‘Cause you're insane

When you're insane
It's the knowing that you can't refrain
When you're insane
