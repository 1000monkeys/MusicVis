I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before

Head in the clouds
Can't break me now
I jumped off this plane
'Cause it was going down
My parachute
I've got nothing left to lose
The wind blows through my hair
And leaves you broken and bruised

I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before, before
Since you've been gone, I've felt so free
To be the person that I wanna be
And I've never felt this way before

Feet on the ground
I was lost, now I'm found
I took cover from the rain
'Cause it was pouring down
You held me back
And now I'm on the right track
You couldn't stop me if you wanted
Cause I'm never coming back

I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before, before
Since you've been gone, I've felt so free
To be the person that I wanna be
And I've never felt this way before
(I've never felt this way before)

I spent all my time depending on you
But after all these fucking years
I'm finally through with you
This is the new me
I'm breaking free
From your chains that held me
So take a look at me now
This is the new me
I'm breaking free
From your chains that held me
And I'm standing proud
Nothing can stop me

I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before, before
Since you've been gone, I've felt so free
To be the person that I wanna be
And I've never felt this way before
(I've never felt this way before)
