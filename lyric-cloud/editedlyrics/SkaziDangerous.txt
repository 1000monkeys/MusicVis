Put the gun down (Rawkus!)

I want a roll a batch colder than the ice you catch
Hardcore, bite my shit, I crack ya polar caps
It's open session on the hopers dreaming
It's open season on the worthless scheming
One of you weak niggas will get stabbed in the throat
With a piece of broken record on some old honest approach
I'm common cold pocket cause the heats waiting
And ya'll look like a bunch of niggas that wanna meet Satan
It's unbearable how I be wrecking your stereo
Shot you with a ? Now it's a different scenario
I got a basement full of caskets
Waiting for you faggots hating
Mr. Freeze dangerous for you maggots skating
On thin ice
That I just produced
You'll get your guts reduced
Yo
I'll rip your shoulders out
I'm wrapped in solar towers
So hot to your heart
I'll make you rip it out and hold it out
Now you can beat it or get beat with it
Each get it with the heat, deal with cheap seated niggas
I had time to sit back in time and time-frame
Wide range, fifty foot brains with a migraine
Ram a fist in your whore, and leave the doors hurtin
Then squeeze a problem and dead it and leave the pores squitin
I drink a glass of magma and shit out hot flashes
You fucked around so long your legs a like a box of stock-matches
Your shit's expired, look your shits on fire
And across town I'm choking your bitch with a strand of piano wire
You dumb motherfuckers will get your wig ripped back
Like it was gift-wrap
You'll be sitting in hell, there receiving a call
To blueprint your brain and trace every curve in your skull

I'm wireless
Connect the day
I'm wireless
You know these niggas don't play
No connectors needed
No respect is needed
No infections treated
All villains get treated the same

I usually steal the show and leave a nigga teethless
And shred his fucking face into a million pieces
And you're only making matters worse
When I squeeze your skinny neck and make your adams burst
I'm cutting percentages out of niggas with a rusty blade
Spit into every crevice where the cuts are made
I ain't the same, when I'm hot seated
Ya'll niggas are low class with no pilots heated
Take my arms and legs and I'll still hold on
To your pathetic attempts
Put a raw gram of liquid acid and set it to rest
Cause your pathetic attempts is the best that it gets
Erase your states of bullshit, put your bitch in a case
And smack you so hard the blood cells rush to the side of your face
Cause I got some sick intentions with connectors needed
Send six in your ribs, The six dimensions
No estrogen from the stores cat, no text is needed
Just a Desert Eagle handle with some pressure needed
This Niggas bleedin, give him a towel
With a gun in the mouth, their only speaking in vowels
I'm stubbin my brains locked like a thousand court cases
And like a doctor without a job, kid I don't have the patience
Split twenty heads, in each district
With two pieces of concrete in my fists
You'll leave with your teeth missing
See, you don't know where the heats sittin
And in a minute you'll be trying to see where the meats rippin
And with your head, neck and your leg
I tie it in knots
Pick you up and drop you off in the midnight deposit box
