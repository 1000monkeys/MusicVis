The rising heat from multiple fires
Cause by the heat flash and the blast wave
Is suckin in grand level winds
At speed exceedin a hundred miles an hour
Within it's center the temperature is risin
To eight hundrer degrees centigrade
This is what technically known as
A firestorm
This is a firestorm!
This is a firestorm!
