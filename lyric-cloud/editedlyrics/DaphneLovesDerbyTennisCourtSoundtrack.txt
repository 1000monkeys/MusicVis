Where have you been?
I've been waiting so long to hear from you
And all the things that we said we would do
Still remains to be nothing more then plans of the past
We've been too quiet for too long
Where is the hope we once had?
It's too late to be saved by your charm
We'll never get this right
Your words are cold, and the season is too
The comfort in your voice is gone
Please don't keep in touch
I'm better off all alone now that you've lost everything I loved
Is this worth the time?
Am I done in your mind?
Will I regret once you're gone?
Why did I ever think that we would be so good?
We've been too quiet for too long
Where is the hope we once had?
It's too late to be saved by your charm
We'll never get this right
All right, I'm sorry that I even tried
I was a fool to have hope in you
