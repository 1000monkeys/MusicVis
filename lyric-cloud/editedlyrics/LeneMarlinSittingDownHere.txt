I'm sitting down here
But hey you can't see me

Your words cut rather deeply, they're just some other lies
I'm hiding from a distance, I've got to pay the price
Defending all against it, I really don't know why
You're obsessed with all my secrets, you always make me cry
You seem to wanna hurt me, no matter what I do
I'm telling just a couple, but somehow it gets to you
But I've learned how to get revenge and I swear you'll experience that some day

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me
Kind of invisible: you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day
I'm sitting down here, but hey you can't see me

I'm not trying to avoid you, just don't wanna hear your voice
When you call me up so often, I don't really have a choice
You're talking like you know me and wanna be my friend
But that's really too late now, I won't try it once again
You may think that I'm loser, that I don't really care
You may think that it's all forgotten, but you should be aware
Cause I've learned to get revenge and I swear you'll experience that some day

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me
Kind of invisible: you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day
I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me
Kind of invisible: you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day
