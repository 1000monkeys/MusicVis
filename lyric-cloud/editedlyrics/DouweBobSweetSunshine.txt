Sweet sunshine, lifting you up
Sweet sunshine, lifting you up

I'm where the ocean meets the land
I've seen the mountains and the desert sand
From up high

Touched the ground and the top of the trees
I hear the thunder in the way that you breathe
Look up to the sky

Sweet sunshine, lifting you up
Sweet sunshine, lifting you up, yeah
Sweet sunshine, come on

I've been around for a billion days
She thinks I appear and then fade away
I need to stay

Sweet sunshine, lifting you up
Sweet sunshine, lifting you up
Sweet sunshine, come on

Sweet sunshine, lifting you up
Sweet sunshine, lifting you up
Sweet sunshine, come on
Sweet sunshine, come on
