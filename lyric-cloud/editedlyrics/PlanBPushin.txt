(Ever keep on pushing?
Ever keep on pushing?
Ever keep on pushing?
Ever keep on pushing?)

Your love is something I can't reach
Close to me, it's there
Holding out your hand, I can feel your heat
Be it off the wall, be right where you are

(Keep on pushing, my love
Ever keep on pushing?
Keep on pushing, my love
Ever keep on pushing?
Keep on pushing, my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love)

Your love is like a paper cup
It's just not deep enough even though it seems so much
I can't help but touch
Even though it makes it worse I keep pushing, pushing through

(Keep on pushing, my love
Ever keep on pushing?
Keep on pushing, my love
Ever keep on pushing?
Keep on pushing, my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love)

Every cloud has a silver lining
And I think I've found mine
What's meant to be is just a matter of time and
Good things come later down the line

Your love is something I can't beat
Your heart is like a game, I just can't complete
So bittersweet, I can't win you over
No real defeat
(Lemme keep on pushing
Lemme keep on pulling)
I can't win you over
No real defeat
(Lemme keep on pushing
Lemme keep on pulling
I can't win you over
No real defeat
Lemme keep on trying)

Every cloud has a silver lining
And I think I've found mine
What's meant to be is just a matter of time and
Good things come later down the line

(Lemme keep on pushing
Lemme keep on pushing, my love
Lemme keep on pushing
Lemme keep on pushing, my love
Lemme keep on pushing
Lemme keep on pushing, my love
My love, my love, my love)
Every cloud has a silver lining
(My love, my love, my love)
And I think I've found mine
