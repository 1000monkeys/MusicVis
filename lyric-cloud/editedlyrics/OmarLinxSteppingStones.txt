I feel at peace, no longer will I fear the beast
The tide is rising but I ain’t built nothing on the beach, I build on concrete
I build that shit strong, they can’t shake me, they been hating, I live on
And I be chilling I ain’t gotta play the villain, I’m tryna see a million but for now I’ll make a killing
Show you if you’re willing, show you that I can, if you down with the boy then I’m sure you in the plans
And if you not you can breathe exhaust
I'mma see the top
You gon’ have to go through life with your fingers crossed, I wish you all the luck
It'll never be enough, cause I don’t need to know your hand just to call your bluff
Oh this my lane from my hustle to my pain, they seein’ them all relate that’s the LinX that’s in my name
From the struggle to the stars, I took it all to heart, if they said I’ll make a fall then I’ll send them my regards

I’m heading my way to no place, away in that stolen car
If you ain’t been on you're highway, then y'all don’t know who you are, you gotten this far
Countin’ your stars, I know they all count on me, just know I'll be there for sunrise
For now just let me be

These are the stepping stones to step up on the ledge alone, to spread your wings and free your mind you gotta let it go
In retrospect I shoulda did it quicker, but my thoughts are overworked and only paid about a fifth of liquor
And no one rushing to my aid cause I don’t show the hurt
, 
I could be bleeding  out my side and still finish first
Foolish pride and ambition got me tripping, but I owe it my success so you know that I’m gon’ listen
Boy I’m ready now scarier than Freddy now
, bout to throw myself a party someone get the damn confetti out
I wish they listened when I told them I would stay, now they all up in my business only getting in my way
Fuck a 9 to 5 I would rather die alive,
 you could see it in my eyes whats the good in even tryna lie
This is my calling if I say it I’m on it, just know that nothing comes free you gotta prove that you want it

I’m heading my way to no place, away in that stolen car
If you ain’t been on you're highway, then y'all don’t know who you are, you gotten this far
Countin’ your stars, I know they all count on me, just know I'll be there for sunrise
For now just let me be

We're so close, we stole dreams, and sold hope, I took doubt and bailed out this old boat
Where most fail, I inhale and blow smoke, if I burn, it’s my turn
I won’t choke, I won‘t die, I won’t fade, I won’t change, I can’t quit
I can’t slow there’s no way, just keep the pedal heavy, tank full, wheels steady, my sharp engine revving, tryna make my way to heaven

I’m heading my way to no place, away in that stolen car
If you ain’t been on you're highway, then y'all don’t know who you are, you gotten this far
Countin’ your stars, I know they all count on me, just know I'll be there for sunrise
For now just let me be
