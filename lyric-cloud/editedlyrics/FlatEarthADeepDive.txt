Ate a mars on the mars for the feeling

I just saw Santa saying Satan is a crack-head hanging on the gold chains and got the silence
Staying in the cold rains then I drop the science
Sippin’ out the old canes and shot the clients
Always been on my roadways, there’s not a single siren
Spiral galaxy in the depths of the night sky and tonight I kill myself in the deep gravity
A catastrophe ‘cause of the astronomy
History on my bench, this bitch is talking with me ______
Typing in the command “/dead end“, you not what you pretend and you should surprised that the angles protect
A part of the falling ends, aliеns ball apart like my downfall’s award, I might port to the death of humanity
Put my body in thе alpha centauri system
Read the mission and feed the existence
Speed the assistance and bleed for the position
We’re only fuckers in the supercluster
The world in the hands of the loser plaster
Looking at the Helix-Nebula and start a future disaster
They sending the Evil-Formula from the Lucifer

I don’t know what’s hit them through the spinal
Fire gon’ glow, I’ma take a long journey, I was hidden to the viral
Remove the bible and choose the new spiral-galaxy
Spin that shit around in the homicidal fantasy
We live in a simulation, tryna wake up in the reality
There‘s an earthquake in the middle of the pandemic
Alien-Brain, I am in Stadium-Pain, fuck Radiant-Chains and fuck cosmetics

Alphabetic flow in alpha centauri, I‘m prophetic
Ufo lunatic, you drug addict watch me kick-flip
Don‘t ignore the fact that you favorite rap fucker is a rat
Arrived at the earth, was never flat, fever black, treasure back, I’m a bastard
R.I.P mankind, we need to change, are we able to change? we ain‘t
Dear aliens protect us at all costs, we crossing the end, we lost and we need to start a new planet

I’ma order this, I’m bored of this, I’m the fucking lord of this nation
Earth is in vibration, first time we ‘bout to unlock new locations
New civilization create new motivation, full transformation, our destination
We just multiplied in alternative universes, we still have alien-replies
You don’t got the ultralight of the places
Necks got ultra wide while the ages

I don't know if I'm wasted, if I waste my time
I‘m ill and able to die, dying in a drive by shooting
I‘m executing my hand and looting his mind to clear his confusion
Human evolution, please take a look at the revolution
Don‘t freeze the solution deep in the constitution
Sleep in my fusion, I‘ma bleed for the fucking devolution

Five killer in my home, dive rippers stole my phone
Got the vendetta for halloween nightmares
On god, when bayonetta drop, might smash my bird on her, repaired
Give a fuck what y'all batterin' 'cause I'm better than everyone, I’m their brain
If I switch a lot up would I be sad or satisfied?
Found my own bone on the mars, tryna hide it, that‘s what it like
Ate a mars on the mars for the feeling

I’ma order this, I’m bored of this, I’m the fucking lord of this nation
Earth is in vibration, first time we ‘bout to unlock new locations
New civilization create new motivation, full transformation, our destination
We just multiplied in alternative universes, we still have alien-replies
You don’t got the ultralight of the places
Necks got ultra wide while the ages

I don’t know what’s hit them through the spinal
Fire gon’ glow, I’ma take a long journey, I was hidden to the viral
Remove the bible and choose the new spiral-galaxy
Spin that shit around in the homicidal fantasy

I don't know if I'm wasted, if I waste my time
I‘m ill and able to die, dying in a drive by shooting
I‘m executing my hand and looting his mind to clear his confusion

Don‘t freeze the solution deep in the constitution
Sleep in my fusion, I‘ma bleed for the fucking devolution
