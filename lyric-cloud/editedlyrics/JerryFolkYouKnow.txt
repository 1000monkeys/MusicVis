You know it's true, you know it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true
Oh, baby, you're my refuge, you're my refuge

You know, you know, you know, know
You know, you know, you know, know
You know, you know, you know, know
You know, you know, you know, know

You know it's true
I see a shelter in you
And all the times that we been through
Oh, baby, you're my refuge
You know it's true, you know it's true
I see a shelter in you
And all the times that we been through
Oh, baby, you're my refuge
