We've seen how strange things can get at night...
Well, things are about to get a whole lot stranger
This mysterious driver tricks cops into thinking he's about to pull over, then all hell breaks loose
His moves are still baffling to the police as he swerves all over the road, driving like a man possessed
In just a moment he's going to make a turn into the twilight zone. Watch
But in the blink of an eye the driver comes into view again
He's wheeling from the cops for a loop, he gets back on the straightaway, showing off a seemingly supernatural speed...
For a moment it appears as if the driver and his car have disappeared into thin air
The officers watching this get only a quick glimpse of the man behind the wheel
It's the last look they'll get
This time, he tries to outrun the police rather than just vanish
A fence at the end means no way out... or does it?
Even watching it again, cops are unable to make sense of it...
All they see is the an intact fence and nothing more than the vanishing taillights of what the Garden City P.D. has come to call: The Ghost Car
