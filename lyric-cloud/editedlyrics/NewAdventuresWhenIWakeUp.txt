 No one told me life was a game
I woke up in a dream lookin life in the face
They said that I could be anything that I may
All it take is some belief, pure intention and aim
No retention in school
I'd rather focus on gains
Like I was up in the gym
Bench pressing and prayin
Tryna flex up my brain
Thinkin how to make change
And not just dollar bills
A bigger vision exchange
From me to the people
No matter the confusion always knew we was equal
Always thought about influence, how we needed a beacon
Someone who could speak the truest, start a movement and be it
Oh how I seen it
But no body catch the vision til you make it
I gambled by the minute taking risks like I'm in Vegas
Followed intuition built my mission I created
Everything I ever wished, I used my gift to heal the nation
Man you knew I had to
 Level up
Level up
This a new vibe this nothing regular
New grooves bummin' through ya cellular
Had to switch the game up had to level up
Level up
Level up
Level up
We on full drive got the pedal pushed
We gon' lift the vibe up til its stellular
This some heavy vibes this here a level up
Level up
 I been through some tight spots
My life is a motion flick movie you might watch
Just another youngin' polluted by ice watches
And price margins
Tryna gain Christ conscious
Ayahuasca had me tweakin
Third eye bulging life has meanin?
Met my monsters and my demons
Inner secrets mental battles like we in the Colosseums
Realized I was going deep my guy
You don't see the magic til you peep my guy
You don't know your trauma til you deep down dive
To the sea grounds, ocean's wide and keeps archives
Of the treasures
Of adolescence
Pressure and pleasure
Many endeavors
Plans and adventures
But not without the
Painstaking
Heartaches and
Moments when we felt anxious
Lost and aimless
Its all patience
Now we livin' life on edge
My lucid dreams continue when I wake up from bed
The moment is Forever that's what stay in my head
Cause we just players within a game that never ends
 Level up
Level up
This a new vibe this nothing regular
New grooves bummin' through ya cellular
Had to switch the game up had to level up
Level up
Level up
Level up
We on full drive got the pedal pushed
We gon' lift the vibe up til its stellular
This some heavy vibes this here a level up
