We see the shadows that are falling from your eyes
Draining your face of everything but the disguise
Don't hide baby, let them see your true colours
Don't mind the camera, let them see your black heart tonight
Don't hide baby, show them just how deep it goes
Don't mind the cameras, let them see your black heart baby

You've been perfect from the start
They told me that time has only done you wrong

We are going to a different place
We're taking everything we can
There's no expression left upon our face
Cause time is running out so fast
We're sinking in the sand

You've been talking from the heart
Saying that I can't be away from life

We are going to a different place
We're taking everything we can
There's no expression left upon our face
Cause time is running out so fast
We're sinking in the sand

We're sinking in the sand
We're sinking in the sand
