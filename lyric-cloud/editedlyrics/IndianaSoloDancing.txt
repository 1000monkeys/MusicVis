I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing, watch me as I go
I go dancing, it's so intense
I will dance 'til the bitter end
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone

Hypnotised by the law of motion
Music stops and the spell is broken

I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing, watch me as I go (watch me as I go, go, go)
I go dancing, it's so intense
I will dance 'til the bitter end
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone

Don't hold back my dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotised by the law of motion
Music stops and the spell is broken (broken, broken)

Ooh, how I move
Ooh, how I move
Ooh, how I move
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't hold back my dance devotion
How I move, how I move, how I move
Ooh, how I move
How I move, how I move, how I move

I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing, watch me as I go
I go dancing, it's so intense
I will dance 'til the bitter end
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone

Don't hold back my dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotised by the law of motion
Music stops and the spell is broken
