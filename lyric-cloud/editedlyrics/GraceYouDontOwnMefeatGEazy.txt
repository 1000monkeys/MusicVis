You don't own me
You don't own me
Well let's go
But I'm Gerald
And I can always just what I want
And she's the baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you dont know
She could never be a broke ho
You don't own me
I'm not just one of y'all many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in anyway
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I never stay
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
R-r-r-really though
Honestly I get bored basic (No)
She's the baddest
Straight up vicious
Sexy girl asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures
She said no
What
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never ask for your help, independent women
She ain't for the shelf
Nah, she's the one
Smoking til the weed is (Ahhh)
Stand up until we see the sun
The baddest ever, I swear she's does it better than I see her done
Yeh yeh
Never borrowed she never loan
Cause I swear she told me that she is never ever ever own
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young
And I love to be young
And im free
And I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
Hey
You don't own me (Ohhh Nooo)
Ok
Ohhh no noooo
You don't own me (Ohhhhhh noooo no no noooo)
Dont you don't
Hey
You don't own me
But just know (Nahhhh)

You don't own me (Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah)
Easy
