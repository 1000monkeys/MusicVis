The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war!
Aa the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor!
The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war!
Aa the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor!

Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at?
Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at?
Freaks at? Freaks at? Freaks at? Freaks at?
Fre-Fre-Fre-Fre-Fre-Fre-Fre-Fre-Fre
Tell me where the freaks at?

We get the bass thumpin', people jumpin'
All over the world
We got the speakers pumpin' Timmy Trumpet
For the women with curves
Got that freak flow, freak show
Welcome to the circus
Let the Leaders lead, Preachers preach
Welcome to the service
Close the curtains on them if 
their
Actin' like they never heard us
See we do this for a purpose
Just to keep their fire burnin'
And we don't need no water, let that
Motherfucker burn
Timmy play your trumpet
Let the people go berserk
