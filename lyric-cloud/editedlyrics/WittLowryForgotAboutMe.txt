Yeah!

It's 2 AM in Southern California
Wonder what the weather's been like
Where you're stayin' out east? Damn, it's crazy
Guess a lot has changed since you last saw me
Remember when the plan used to be about 'we'
Stayin' in the west for about four weeks
Feelings come alive while the whole world sleep
Do you feel anything when you think about me?
I've been thinkin' 'bout the times that we had
The day you brought me home to your dad
Now I can't remember your laugh
Why am I obsessed with the past?
Why are you obsessed with your last?
Talk about a lame motherfucker
Everybody know that I'm up, right now
3 AM thoughts got me up, right now
Wonder if you ever gave a fuck, right now
Wonder who you tellin' that you love, right now, yeah
Time don't heal, only you will heal you
All I wanted was the real you

You lied to me now, how'd you do (That)?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you-ou
Told me that, told me that this ain't you
Tell me you forgot about me
Can't believe you forgot about me
Can't tell me you ever thought about me
How'd you do (That)?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you-ou
Told me that, told me that this ain't you
Tell me you forgot about me
Can't believe you forgot about me
Can't tell me that you ever thought about me

It's 4 AM in Southern California
Right around the hour when I start to think a little too deep, damn
I don't know
I don't hate you, I just hate that you forgot about me
Remember back when I would care what people thought about me
If only you had on the feelin's that you caught around me
If only I (Only I, only)
Or, maybe I'm a little too broken
Tried to pick me up, it was hopeless
Gave you all the pieces of my heart, told you, "Hold this"
I wonder if you seein' anything that I'm postin'
I know you post shit so I notice
Team tellin' me to stay focused
Fans tellin' me they need more shit
Labels wanting me to be soulless
I don't need your money, shut up, point to where the throne is
Lately hate that I can tell what anybody's motive is
Everyone around me getting high, right now
Sayin' that I love you is a lie, right now
Sayin' I don't miss you is a lie, right now
Wonder if you find me on your mind, right now
New man got you on the side, right now
New lips, tell me how they lie, right now
New car tell me how it drive, right now
New watch telling me it's five, right now, yeah
Haven't been sleepin' a lot
Remember when you made fun of me 'cause I sleep in my socks
Back when I'd sleep like a rock
Can't sleep now at all, damn
Time don't heal, only you will heal you
All I wanted was the real you

You lied to me now, how'd you do (That)?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you-ou
Told me that, told me that this ain't you
Tell me you forgot about me
Can't believe you forgot about me
Can't tell me you ever thought about me
How'd you do (That)?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you-ou
Told me that, told me that this ain't you
Tell me you forgot about me
Can't believe you forgot about me
Can't tell me that you ever thought about me

It's 8 AM in Southern California
Remember when the plan was for us to move west?
Wonder if you still have the heart you would hang from your neck
Or you threw that away, like my trust, I'm a mess
I don't know (I don't know, know)
If you listen, I could tell you all the feelin's I don't show (Show)
But I'm up right now
Wonder if I'll ever fall in love, right now
Wonder if I'll ever meet the one, right now
Wonder if you're missin' what it was, right now
Wishing I could answer all above, right now
Time don't heal, only you will heal you
All I wanted was the real you

You lied to me now, how'd you do (That)?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you-ou
Told me that, told me that this ain't you
Tell me you forgot about me
Can't believe you forgot about me
Can't tell me you ever thought about me
How'd you do (That)?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you-ou
Told me that, told me that this ain't you
Tell me you forgot about me
Can't believe you forgot about me
Can't tell me that you ever thought about me
