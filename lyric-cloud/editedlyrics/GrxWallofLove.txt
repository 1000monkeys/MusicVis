Child of all creation, don't let the world define you
And if you can't remember who you are
Let these words remind you
On the path of the empty-handed
He will speak to the heart of the abandoned
These orphan hearts will find a home
Run to these arms, be not alone
Light is leading, love will find us all
Love will find us all
So hard to feel the fires of home when all we see is darkness
We forget we're not our own and grasp for what's around us
Till the dawn starts to break around you
Let all the stars in the night remind you
These orphan hearts will find a home
Run to these arms, be not alone
Light is leading, love will find us all
Love will find us all
These orphan hearts will find a home
Run to these arms, be not alone
Light is leading, love will find us
These orphan hearts will find a home
Run to these arms, be not alone
Light is leading, love will find us all
Love will find us all
Run to these arms, be not alone
Run to these arms, be not alone
Run to these arms, be not alone
Run to these arms, be not alone
Love will find us all
Love will find us all
Love will find us all (Run to these arms, be not alone)
Love will find us all (Run to these arms, be not alone)
Love will find us all
Love will find us all
