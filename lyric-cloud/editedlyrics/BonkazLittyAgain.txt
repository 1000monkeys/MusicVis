Yeah
I don't wanna hear no Top 5 debates, Top 10 debates
None of that shit no more man
It's a dead conversation fam

Look
I ain't got Ps for the rave
But I just took Ps out the safe
Spent on a bike
I don't even know how to ride
My G, I'm just keeping a faith
Squeezing the brakes
Keeping little Gs in the place
Let 'em know Heath isn't safe
Squeezing the eight
 a rookie
I'ma leave a little need in the lake
They see me and hate
Bam bam, bricks on the deck
Need a matt black whip like Krept
 stick, it's a Tec
Bam bam, rip up your set
 dick in your ass
She bang that shit when I press
Flash cats quickly in Wes
Back from Vivienne West
SatNav giver her address
She give me her neck

I been in the field like a farmer
I put in my work, they can't take that away from me
In the White House like Obama
Just cooking on work like it's sweet or it's savoury
Preeing my thing like I'm Emory
Your team and your Gs ain't the same as me
And she might be with you but that ain't a issue
She told all her friends that she's dating me, bitch

Hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out the piff and the tropic, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't want to see the squad
They don't want to see the Wraith
They don't want to see your bitch up in the stars like she going outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

To stunt is a bonus
'Bout to get a new Rolex presidential
Truss, I'ma trump my opponents
I'm nuts like a 
My youngers are olders
I come with the coldest, I dump and reload it
I'm young but I'm focused, you're dumb and you're hopeless
I'm running your drum with my soldiers
Like fuck who you roll with 
I roll with the gang (gang, gang, gang, gang)
Niggas talk shit, man they know that I bang (bang, bang, bang, bang)
Talk on the mic, but I know that you're prang
Stalking my life from the low, you're a fan
Your bitch is so ugly I ain't throwing shade
But I stay in the shade 'cause I throw 'em on a tan
Don't wanna be focused on Gs
I'm focused on bands, they focused on me
Focused on man, focused on man
Pause, how you focus on a man
Bet your boy get banged
I don't wanna hear Top 5 talks
Cuh get shot when I drop my sauce
More time I don't really roll with the MCs
Tell them man that it's not by force

Straight savage like 21, man I go at it with anyone
Wanna bring hard man, wait, then I Marvin Gay, let's get it on
Four five and a door with the rhyming, I  anyone
Four five turn a yout to a body, turn that body to a skeleton

Hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out the piff and the tropic, it litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't want to see the squad
They don't want to see the Wraith
They don't want to see your bitch up in the stars like she going outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again
