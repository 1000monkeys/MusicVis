Even if I was trippin' I can’t give it up
Rise to the occasion
And my mind can't give it up
The struggle blur my vision

Na give up the opposition
Rise to the occasion
No difference between my opponents
Like explosions

I loose my thoughts
Oh like a poison
Mi body suffer erosion
Rack dem all mi come fi another round


Even if I was trippin' I can’t give it up
Rise to the occasion
And my mind can't give it up
The struggle blur my vision

Even if I was trippin' I can't give it up
Rise to the occasion
Na give up the opposition
Rise to the occasion

I got it, I got it, I got it
Keep my spirit clear
I got it, I got it, I got it
Rack dem all mi come fi another round


I got it, I got it, I got it
Keep my spirit clear
I got it, I got it, I got it
Rack dem all mi come fi another round
