I took the game in my hands, and now its mines to transform
You wake up in the sky, when I arrive, you gon see thunderstorms
Stormy shit, morgue trips
Your whole wig fully split
On some true gully shit
Yall soft like fur, sully shit
The bars hit you like Mufasa getting trampled
Ya'll ain't cooking up shit with that canned food
I'm a shining example, simply doing what they can't do
They know its a wrap with when rap I got Seran too
Usain Bolt, so many beats I ran through
Shooters in my hood, they'll click clack and they'll Blam you
Yall product be diluted, but I'm the prince of the future
I didn't say King, cuz the King's Dead no future
I got power like Vegito, no fusion
They thinking that they clever they suffer from delusion
I come from outta nowhere to dispel the illusions
I can go medieval and we'll turn this whole shit feudal
But it would be gruesome, cuz I kill shit so brutal
Nigga I'm so sick I got blood in my mucous
I'm a fucking murderer, peep blood on my shoeprints
I just the paint the blueprint of my one-man movement
I give 100% to move one damn unit
Me and the mic united in one damn union
Oh, and I've been cheating with the beat
And I've been fucking on the flow
I heard they flirting with defeat
