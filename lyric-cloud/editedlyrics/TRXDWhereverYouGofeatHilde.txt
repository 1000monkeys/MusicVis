When I grew up, I used to think
That all I want is fast cars and diamond rings
Infinity pool to dive in
But that don't compare to what you're hiding
I'll give it up, everything
Just for a second, a minute with you, baby
All that I want is in you
I've found it all in you

Yeah, I knew it straight away when we met for the first time all alone
And just like that it snapped I'm never goin' home

I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)

The way that you look when feeling down
Kickin' up dust 'cause you like the sound
You're cute as can be, I'm mesmerized
You can break a girl's heart with just your eyes

I knew it from the start that even if the cold wind starts to blow
I'll stay right here with you ,you'll never be alone

I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)

Imma dig deeper for your love
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
Imma work harder for your love
(Oh oh oh)
Imma dig deeper for your love
Imma work harder for your love
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
Imma dig deeper for your love
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
Imma work harder for your love
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)
I will go wherever you go
