18 in a haze, memories of the days
Climbing up to this place
We live nights in the flame
Bold dreams in our brain
But we know we're okay
Just like a storm, it's rising
Lights up a spark inside us
Don't act like it's surprising

Pop a champagne, start a fire
We made it, we made it
Put your hands up, raise them higher
We made it (yeah)
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world

(Rise up)
I remember our youth
Midnight, gin 'n' juice
 I was the truth
Madness when we could
All misunderstood
We made Hollywood
Now we've been rising higher
We stumbled through the power
We laugh, 'cuz we surprised ya'

(Yeah)
Pop a champagne, start a fire
We made it, we made it
Put your hands up, raise them higher
We made it (yeah)
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world

It ain't never gonna be enough
It ain't never gonna be enough
It ain't never gonna be enough
It ain't never gonna be enough

Pop a champagne, start a fire
We made it, we made it
Put your hands up, raise them higher
We made it (yeah)
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
