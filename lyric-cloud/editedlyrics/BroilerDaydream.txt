Let's wait a while, we had a moment
I spoke the words so clear
We walked a mile out of nowhere
You stole the atmosphere
But I don't know, it's the way you do it, baby
You know what you do to me
But I don't know, it's the way you do it, baby
You know what you do to me
Trying to get a grip around it
And why do I stay awake all day and dream?
Ain't gonna get no sleep up out of it
Take me away, it's time to up and leave
The daydream, the daydream, yeah
The daydream, the daydream, yeah
The daydream, the daydream, yeah
A silver line across the ocean
Shimmers back to you
I keep my mind set in motion
Cause you're a dream come true
But I don't know, it's the way you do it, baby
You know what you do to me
But I don't know, it's the way you do it, baby
You know what you do to me
Trying to get a grip around it
And why do I stay awake all day and dream?
Ain't gonna get no sleep up out of it
Take me away, it's time to up and leave
The daydream, the daydream, yeah
The daydream, the daydream, yeah
The daydream, the daydream, yeah
