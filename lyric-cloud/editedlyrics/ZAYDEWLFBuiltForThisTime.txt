Standing there on the edge
Ain't scared of whats ahead
Walking up like revenge
I was built for this time
Bleeding red like the sun
Taking over everyone
Watch me as I overcome
I was built for this time

Keep the blood pumpin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
I was built for this
Built for this time
Keep the blood pumpin'
You know I ain't stoppin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
I was built for this
Built for this time

Don't try me I'm untouchable
Surviving like an animal
It's almost like I'm flammable
I was built for this time

Keep the blood pumpin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
I was built for this
Built for this time
Keep the blood pumpin'
You know I ain't stoppin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
I was built for this
Built for this time

The blood gonna be, pumpin'
The blood gonna be, pumpin'
The blood gonna be, pumpin'
The blood gonna be, pumpin'

Keep the blood pumpin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
I was built for this
Built for this time
Keep the blood pumpin'
You know I ain't stoppin'
Keep the blood pumpin'
I was built for this
Built for this time
