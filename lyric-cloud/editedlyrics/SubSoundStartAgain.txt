I wake up looking in the mirror
Wondering who is looking back
I'm so lost with myself
I just can't understand
I say one thing and then do another
My life is set without a plan
If only I could live for the future
Instead of living in the now

Whoa, let's go back
And try and do it right
Who said we can't?
Let's make the time to work it out
I know, that I can do it better
With the help from someone that knows
Just what went wrong

Let's start again
Let's start again
Let's start again

My innocence has left me blind
(Blind from what is right)
And now I've fallen in a state of mind
If only this is something I can fight
I try my best to put things right
But it's easier said than done
I need to reconstruct my mind
Start again and put the pieces back to one

Whoa, let's go back
And try and do it right
Who said we can't?
Let's make the time to work it out
I know, that I can do it better
With the help from someone that knows
Just what went wrong

Let's start again
Let's start again
Let's start again
