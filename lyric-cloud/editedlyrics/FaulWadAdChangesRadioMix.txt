Baby, I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day
Baby, I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day
Honey, I hear you
And I feel for you
It won't be too long till
We're back as one again
Just love, just love, just love, and just love, and just love, and and again!)
Baby, I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way

Honey, I hear you
And I feel for you
It won't be too long till
We're back as one again
(Just love, just love, just love, just love)
