Just listen
That’s the way computers talk to each other
On the outside looking in
Not knowing where I’ve been
Traveling through light and sound
I wanna know the real world
To verify reality
I just wanna be found
I just wanna be found
I just wanna be found
On the outside looking in
Not knowing where I’ve been
Traveling through light and sound
I wanna know the real world
To verify reality
I just wanna be found
I just wanna be found
I just wanna be found
