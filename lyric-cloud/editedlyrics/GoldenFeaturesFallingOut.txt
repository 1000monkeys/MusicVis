I can maybe fall for you as a friend
Can you see the dork in anyone?
I can maybe fall for the light in the skies
I can see the dark in everyone

Did you see it all? did you see it all?
Let us take it over, let us take it all

Falling out
Falling out
Falling out

I can maybe fall for you as a friend
Can you see the dork in anyone?
I can maybe fall for the light in the skies
I can see the dark in everyone

Did you see it all? did you see it all?
Let us take it over, let us take it all

Falling out
Falling out
Falling out

Got it all for you again
I don't know, I don't need love
You got it all for us again
Hold on now I don't need love
I can maybe fall for you as a friend
Can you see the dork in anyone?
I can maybe fall for the light in the skies
I can see the dark in everyone

Falling out
Falling out
Falling out
