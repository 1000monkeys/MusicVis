Are you deaf, can you hear me?
'Cause I'm sick of it all
Always digging in my skin
Always pushing my back to the wall
In my eyes there's a madness
Can't believe what I saw
And I'll be here laughing
When you fall

And there's nothing to say
'Cause I'm already gone
You know I'm not like you
You were never wrong
Go ahead walk away
But I want you to know
I always hated you
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello

Listen up, can you feel this?
'Cause the curtain has called
I will never regret it
And I'll be here watching it all
This is not what I wanted
But I think you'll recall
That I promised I'd be here
When you crawl

And there's nothing to say
'Cause I'm already gone
You know I'm not like you
You were never wrong
Go ahead walk away
But I want you to know
I always hated you
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello

And I can feel the anger in me start to grow
(All the hate that's inside me)
(Overtaking me)
And everything about you is fake and hollow
(All the things that they can't see)
(Are the things I see)
And no one's gonna stop you when you go

And there's nothing to say
'Cause I'm already gone
You know I'm not like you
You were never wrong
Go ahead walk away
But I want you to know
I always hated you
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello
