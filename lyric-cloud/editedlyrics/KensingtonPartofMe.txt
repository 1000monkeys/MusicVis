It is a part of me
And it breaks my heart to see
I was a part of you
When no one else could be

It is a part of me
And it breaks my heart to see
It wasn't all of you
But it takes a lot to leave

I know though whatever what my instincts tell me
I keep on coming back
I know if I'm honest that I can't see clear
And it's hard to hear that

I found the answers in a place I don't belong
Will I bend?
Will I fold?
Will I surrender?

It is a part of me
And it breaks my arms to carry
You'll take it all with you
And leave it dead and buried

I know though whatever what my instincts tell me
I keep on coming back
I know if I'm honest that I can't see clear
And its hard to hear that

I found the answers in a place I don't belong
Will I bend?
Will I fold?
Will I surrender?
And I was bound to be the last man standing all along
Will I slip?
Will I break?
Will I remember?
Will I remember?

Could it be it's a waste on somebody like me?
Could it be it's a waste on somebody like me?

I found the answers in a place I don't belong
Will I bend?
Will I fold?
Will I surrender?
And I was bound to be the last man standing all along
Will I slip?
Will I break?
Will I remember?
Will I remember?
Will I remember?

It was a part of me
And it breaks my heart to see
I was a part of you
When no one else could be
