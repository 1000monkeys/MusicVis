Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Filling the lungs inside you
In the blackest night
Make my way into your mind
Just to know what you knew
Restless every time we start locking eyes
Oh oh oh oh
Lost control
Oh it’s paradise with a nasty bite
Oh oh oh oh
In the dead of the night
Let the darkness take control

Let the darkness take control
Darkness take control
May the darkness take control
Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Sink to your heart to find you
Open up your eyes
'Til you're blinded by the lies
So you can see what you do
Restless every time we start locking eyes
Oh oh oh oh
Lost control
Oh it’s paradise with a nasty bite
Oh oh oh oh
In the dead of the night
Teardrops on the floor
The pain is over
Feel the darkness
Take control

May the darkness take control
