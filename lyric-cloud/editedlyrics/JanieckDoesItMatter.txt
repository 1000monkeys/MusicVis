You are all I need
Coming from a guy that’s on his knees
At least say it’s fine, but honestly
I can't believe it
That you ain’t leavin’
The world keeps testing me
What can we expect, I am only 23
You say I am alright
But I am far too weak
I can't believe it
That you ain’t leavin’

I know that I’ve hurt you
Believe when I say
I never meant to
Treat you this way
Deserve much better
I am such a cliché
What does it matter

And did it crush your mind
‘Cause I see a strange look in your eyes
And every time it’s there, I paralyze
My hearts stops with beating
Afraid that you leavin’

I know that I’ve hurt you
Believe when I say
I never meant to
Treat you this way
Deserve much better
I am such a cliche
What does it matter
I know that I’ve hurt you
Believe when I say
I never meant to
Treat you this way
Deserve much better
I am such a cliché
What does it matter

Do you think you’re better off alone?
Do you think you’re better off alone?
Do you think you’re better off alone?
Do you think you’re better off alone?

I know that I’ve hurt you
Believe when I say
I never meant to
Treat you this way
Deserve much better
I am such a cliché
What does it matter

Do you think you’re better off alone?
Do you think you’re better off alone?
