Four walls surrounding me
Thin like skin and soaked to their bones
By the breath my body is breathing
My eyes turn red from the smoke we blow
There's nothing like the sound we grow
Pumping from the speakers deafen my ears
And force my bleeding feet to move continuously
To the beat destructing the world outside when we show of
Daylight turns into night
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
We're not alone in this building
But still we burn it down
Cause we're fucking addicted to this sound
Like a junk on music trips I puke out lines
The bas s is pumping through my system
I need to hear it twice
Neighbors in flames knocking at my door
Turn that shit down it's pumping way too loud!
For days you terrorise us with your sound!"
I say: Fuck it, its time to share some musical love!
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
Neighbor, neighbor, neighbor don't call the systems guard
The detoxication of our hearts has moved to far
Neighbor, neighbor, neighbor don't call the systems guard
The riot conspiracy has moved too far
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
They gonna kill us cause I've been bad before
But I'm just a man with a microphone
They gonna kill us
Uh yes, they gonna kill us
