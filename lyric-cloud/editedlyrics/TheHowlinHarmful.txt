I'd love to leave my guilty ways behind
I Got all these worries on my mind
And lord I know it's all cliché
Seems like I just can't find my way
Cause I'm harmful
Harmful to myself
Harmful to my neighbours
And everybody else
It's disgraceful but I tried
Tried to be civilized
And get recognized
But it's harmful, yeah
I think I lost track of the time
Feels like I'm fallin behind
And lord I know it's all cliché
Seems like I just can't find my way
Cause I'm harmful
Harmful to myself
Harmful to my neighbours
And everybody else
It's disgraceful but I tried
Tried to be civilized
And get recognized
But it's harmful, yeah
The darkness is a hole I see
It sure is taking it's toll on me
The light at the end of the tunnel is out of sight
And outta my mind
When I'm harmful
Harmful to myself
Harmful to my neighbours
And everybody else
It's disgraceful but I tried
Tried to be civilized
And get recognized
But it's harmful, yeah
And I see the man I ought to be
Oh walkin gracefully, while I'm ....
Oh it's disgraceful but I tried
I tried to be civilized
And get recognized
But it's harmful, yeah
It sure is taking it's toll on me
