Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I should've stayed at home
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
