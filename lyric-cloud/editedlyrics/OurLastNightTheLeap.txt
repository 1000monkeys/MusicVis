Frozen in time
When the world is moving at the speed of light
Trapped inside these walls, you can't rise until you fall
And start to trust your heart over your mind
A diamond turned to stone
From the fear of falling into the great unknown
You're trapped in endless nights, you've lost the will to fight
Like a lantern that's lost its glow

You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
(Paralyzed, afraid to take the leap)

These chains grow stronger with time
But they can still be broken, you're not alone in this fight
Trapped inside these shells
The best version of ourselves is waiting to escape this hell

You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap

The only way to survive this life is to take the leap
The only way to survive this life is to take the leap

You're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap

The only way to survive this life is to take the leap
The only way to survive this life is to take the leap
(The only way to survive this life is to take the leap)
