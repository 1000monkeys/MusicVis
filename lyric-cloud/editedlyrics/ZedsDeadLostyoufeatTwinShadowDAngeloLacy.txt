I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you AS IF I LOST YOU
I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you AS IF I LOST YOU
It's the sickest kinda feeling I got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out and you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free
It's the sickest kinda feeling I got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out and you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free
WE LOVE TO LOVE
We love to touch
This world needs people to be in love
