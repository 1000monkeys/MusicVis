Hold it in long when you breathe it in
And it all will be a better shade, love
So it is a lie you believe in?
I know it is a sight to behold
If only there's a line when you need it
All to get a way with words you don't know
How many times will you beat it in
'til all that was alight has gone dark?
I know you want to fly but you needn't
Take everything and bringing it down
But no we had to try to achieve it
Oh, you got a way with words you don't know
So, you got here just to get away
You got here just to get away
But only will the right hands know
To hold, and lead you in a better way
Lead you in a better way
Only in the right hands
Only in the right hands
Open up wide, now get it inside
And leave it inside and lay low
What a happy day, what a happy day
There you go, there you go
There you go and you're gone
All of those lies
They're creeping inside
Now will we hold on or let go?
For the life of me, for the life of me
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
And so, you got here just to get away
You got here just to get away
But only will the right hands know
To hold, and lead you in a better way
Lead you in a better way
Only in the right hands
Only in the right hands
Oh, when we get away
Oh, when we get away
All will be alright
All will be alright
So, you got here just to get away
You got here just to get away
But only will the right hands know
To hold, and lead you in a better way
Lead you in a better way
Only in the right hands
Only in the right hands
You got here just to get away
You got here just to get away
But no one with the right hands knows
That oh, you're ready for a better day
You're ready for a better day
Only in the right hands
Only in the right hands
