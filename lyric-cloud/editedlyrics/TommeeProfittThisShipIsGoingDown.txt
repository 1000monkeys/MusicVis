Rise up and come out of where you hide
We are gonna make it out of here alive
Rise up and leave, no one left behind
Everybody save yourself tonight

Oh, caught in a crossfire now
Our, our time is running out

This ship is going down
This ship is going down
This ship is going down
This ship is going down
This ship is going down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
This ship is going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down

We can feel water to our knees
Our world is crumbling under our feet
Rise up and take whatever you need
We are gonna make it out in one piece

Oh, caught in a crossfire now
Our, our time is running out

This ship is going down
This ship is going down
This ship is going down
This ship is going down
This ship is going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
This ship is going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
This shipping is going down

Ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahh
Ahh, ah-ahh, ahh

Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
This ship is going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
This ship is going down
