I don't care how far you go from me, I know you're still my baby
We got something I can't explain
Still it kills to watch you walk away and take the heart you gave me
But deep down, I know we'll never change

So if you're leaving
I'm not gonna stop you
I'm not gonna stop you
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know

In my mind, I know I have to let you go and set you free, boy
'Cause that's how you know it's meant to be
I don't want to give up and lose you for a single minute
But in time, you'll come back home to me

So if you're leaving
I'm not gonna stop you
I'm not gonna stop you
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm not gonna stop you
