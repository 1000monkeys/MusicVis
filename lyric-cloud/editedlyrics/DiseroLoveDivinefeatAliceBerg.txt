So high on love
Powerful drug, yeah
As I dreamed of more than what it seemed
We sobered up (up, up, up)
Under your touch (under your touch)
Just like I’m far apart (just like I’m far apart)
Holding onto something we don’t need
To get enough

Ooh, grab me; I’m so high
And I know that I’ll be fine
With you, don’t know what to do
Am I acting like a fool
Love divine

(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine

Under your touch (under your touch)
Just like I’m far apart (just like I’m far apart)
Holding onto something we don’t need
To get enough

Ooh, grab me; I’m so high
And I know that I’ll be fine
With you, don’t know what to do
Am I acting like a fool
Love divine
Love divine

(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
(Just like I’m far apart)
Love divine
