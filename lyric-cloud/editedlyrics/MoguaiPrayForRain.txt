If you were a star, you would never fade
Even through stormy weather, you're a cloud away
If you were the sun, I'd cease the day, yeah
And if your love came in showers
I would pray for rain
I would pray for rain
Pray for rain
If your love came in showers
I would pray for rain
I would pray for rain
Pray for rain
If your love game in showers
I would pay for rain
If you were a star you would never fade
Even through stormy weather you're a cloud away
If you were the sun, I would cease the day
If your love came in showers
I would pray for rain
I would pray for rain
I would pray for rain
If your love came in showers
I would pray for rain
I would pray for rain
Pray for rain
If you love came in showers
I would pray for rain
I would pray for rain
Pray for rain
If your love came in showers
I would pray for rain
