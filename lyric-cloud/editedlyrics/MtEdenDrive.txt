I'm caught up when you look at me
You let my heart breathe with ease
Chasing stars in our galaxy
Making our own make-believe
I want you when the sun goes low
Your body warmth wants me close
You say you're always by my side
'Till my blood runs dry
I'll take you for a drive
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the color of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you
I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise
I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise in my heart(I'll take you for a drive)
I'll take you for a drive
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the color of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the color of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you
I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise in my heart(I'll take you for a drive)
I'll take you for a drive
