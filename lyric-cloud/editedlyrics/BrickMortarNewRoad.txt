I'm with the dead boys
The weed, the cocaine
We're acting stupid
To get through the day
'Cause everybody's using
In the U.S.A
'Cause everybody's using
To get through the day

I wanna make a new road
I wanna walk and feel the earth fly by
I wanna walk till I've found myself
Walk out 'cause I walked a mile high
Right now
See me, fear me right now

I'm a thief
I'm a thief in the night
While you sleep I'll be stealing your dreams
And everything you dream
Gonna hold in between my hands
Gonna show it to the world
Like it's mine and pretend you're dead
I'm a thief in the night while you sleep

To night again
Night into day into day into night
Into night again
Truth is the reason, oh truth is the reason
We lie again
Night into day into day into night
Into night, again
Truth is the reason, the truth is

I wanna make a new road
I wanna walk and feel the earth fly by
I wanna walk 'till I've found myself
Walk out 'cause I walked a mile high

I wanna grow (I wanna grow)
Reach up to the sky (Reach up to the sky)
I wanna know
Everything like I see with my eyes

Right now
See me, fear me right now
Right now
See me, fear me right now
(Right now)
(See me, fear me right now)
