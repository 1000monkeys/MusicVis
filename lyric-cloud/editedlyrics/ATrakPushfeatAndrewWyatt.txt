Let down, a light that fuckers off in the basement
Let down, tonight i feel my courage breaking
I made a mess
Off easy stuff
I care too much
Don't care enough
I wrestle with my attitude
You're mad at me
I'm tired of you
And it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away
Yeah it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away
Let down, i feel your disconnect emotion
Let down, you stand there cold and proud like i'm not your man
And i feel trapped
And gave my world
Not to hang out
Whit other girls
I made you feel
Like i'm all yours
But i can't stop
Myself on tours
And it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away
Yeah it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away
And it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away
Yeah it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away
