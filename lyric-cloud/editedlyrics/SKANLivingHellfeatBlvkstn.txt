'Cause this game is like a fucking trap
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck and I won't make it back
And I, I can't go on like this
I can't go on like this
I can't go on no woah oh
And this world is like a living hell
Sometimes I feel I'm trapped in a prison cell
And I, I can't go on like this
I can't go on like this
I can't go on no woah oh
'Cause this world is like a living hell
'Cause this world is like a living hell

I'm ready to blow I be lit and I’m warming
I’m positive money be coming we growing
I knew that I had it the moment I was born
And I’m keepin', keepin', keepin' it going
I’m keeping it glowing, and frequently 4 in the morning
Is when I be freaking and boning
I’m keeping her moaning while I be d-deep in her zoning
I’m seek and disowning
Destroying I’m on, with a bomb, with a bomb, with a bang, with a boom, what a bam, what a night
I’m feeling like a dog, in a fog, in bog, in cog, gonna bark all night
In a fight, with a right, wit a lot , with a plot, what I got, what I give, what I had, what it do
I never would a thought I be this close feeling all alone what a god gonna do, gotta make it count

And this world is like a living hell
Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped in a prison cell
And I, I can't go on like this
I can't go on like this
I can't go on no woah oh

If you ain't livin' in hell
Then how you gon' make it to heaven?
It's the yin and the yang
Everything sixes and sevens
There's good and there's evil
It just depends on the people
And what you do while you're here
If you gon' make it to the sequel
What goes up must come down
What comes around goes around
Hold it down, make sure they know you don't fuck around
Everything's comin' waves, as soon as you catch it you straight
It all just keeps spinnin' around like a big hurricane

'Cause this game is like a fucking trap
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck and I won't make it back
And I, I can't go on like this
I can't go on like this
I can't go on no woah oh
And this world is like a living hell
Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped in a prison cell
And I, I can't go on like this
I can't go on like this
I can't go on no woah oh
'Cause this world is like a living hell
'Cause this world is like a living hell
Like a living hell
