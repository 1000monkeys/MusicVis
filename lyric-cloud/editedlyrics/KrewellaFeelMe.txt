Can't control it, but it's coming like a thunderin', the sound
I could feel before I knew it, then you slapped me on the ground
Then you took me like I'd never had that whiskey in my veins
Ever since you've been on repeat, like the music in my brain

You feel me — I feel you
I need to know the taste that's on your lips
And I see — only you
'Cause no one's ever touched me there like this

No more waitin' baby, take it till you lose your fuckin' mind
I can feel you on my skin and I am slowly goin' blind
And your touch is like the only thing that I will ever need
Sink your teeth into my veins until my heart is on your sleeve

You feel me — I feel you
I need to know the taste that's on your lips
And I see — only you
'Cause no one's ever touched me there like this
