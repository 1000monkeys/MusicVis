You gotta fight when you're failing
You gotta learn when they stab you in the back
And when you're down and you're hating
You gotta learn how to keep you all intact

When you love and you losing
Get up 'cause this is where you at
You gotta fight when you're failing
Stand tall, no bailing

What you gonna do when it all falls down?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, re-take it
What you gonna do when you hit the ground?
Get up, get up, get up, get up and face it
What you gonna do when you feeling down?
You wanna get up, stand up and you'll make it
What you gonna do when you hit the ground?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, just face it
You gotta face it

You gotta learn when you hurting
You gotta get up and put the pieces back
You know we all get too certain
Sometimes, yeah, we losing things we get

When you love and you losing
Get up 'cause this is where you at
You gotta fight when you're failing
Stand tall, no bailing

What you gonna do when it all falls down?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, re-take it
What you gonna do when you hit the ground?
Get up, get up, get up, get up and face it
What you gonna do when you feeling down?
You wanna get up, stand up and you'll make it
What you gonna do when you hit the ground?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, just face it
You gotta face it

Turning to my better self
When you're not around me
I forget to love myself
Hope that you'll remind me

What you gonna do when you feeling down?
You wanna get up, stand up and you'll make it
What you gonna do when you hit the ground?
Get up, get up, get up, get up, just face it
You gotta face it
