Nobody here, knocking at my door
The sound of silence, I can’t take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the show without your light
No, I don’t even know if I'm alive
Oh, without you now, this is what it feels like
Nothing to hold but the memories and frames
Oh, they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I'd drown
Somebody save me, I'm going down
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the show without your light
No, I don’t even know if I'm alive
Oh, without you now, this is what it feels like
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it down the road with one headlight
No, I don’t even know if I'm alive
Oh, without you now, this is what it feels like
