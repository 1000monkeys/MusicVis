The coldest night came in the spring
The final frost was laid again
We draft the roof, froze the shoots, killed the flowers
And stole the colour from the sun

Oh let the river in, burst the dams and start again
Oh let the river in, the will of men can't hold it in
Oh let the river in, as the blood beneath my skin
Let the river in - nature plays, nature wins

You held on to my hands like a vice
You turn the screw, turn them right
But there's a point, there's a limit where we break
The current finds the quickest way

So let the river in, burst the dams and start again
Oh let the river in, the will of men can't hold it in
Oh let the river in, as the blood beneath my skin
Let the river in - nature plays, nature wins

(I hear the breaking of bricks and walls)
(I feel the rhythm of the water)
I hear the breaking of bricks and walls
I feel the rhythm of the water

Oh let the river in, burst the dams and start again
Oh let the river in, the will of men can't hold it in
Oh let the river in, as the blood beneath my skin
Let the river in - nature plays, nature wins
Oh let the river in, burst the dams and start again
Oh let the river in, the will of men can't hold it in
Oh let the river in, as the blood beneath my skin
Oh let the river in - nature plays, nature wins
