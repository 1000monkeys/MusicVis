EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
SKRILLEX!
VS!
MOZART!
BEGIN!

My name is Skrillex, man!
 
Welcome to the Devil's Den
I'm a scary monster stomping this sprite in frilly pants
You're a weirdo, 
Wolfy
, you're into 
powdered wigs
 & 
poop!
And your cousin blew notes on your little Magic Flute
Your daddy issues make the Jackson 5 look like the Family Circus!
You might have been a genius but you died
 
baroque and worthless!
I'm rich, acclaimed, and famous,
 
I'm on playlists,
 
I'm the A-List!
You're the lamest,
 
kiss my ass
 
A-A-A-A-Amadeus

Was that a verse, or did you just get the hiccups
?
I'm a prodigy, Sonny, and I'm about to smack a bitch up
!
My music is 200 years old,
 
and it's still excellent!
In two more months
 
the world will forget about your
 
Skrill-excrement
I can't believe the way you dress
 when you 
dubstep out of the house
You're like an emo Steve Urkel
 
and you (ooh) reek of dead mouse!
I am the world's greatest composer!
 
No one knows what you are!
Except a lonely little troll
 
who knows how to press a spacebar!

I attack! You decay!
 Can't 
sustain
 my 
releases
!
Sidechain
, 
Wolfgang
, 
Bangarang
 you to pieces
I'm a self-made man, you're a slave to your papa!
I'm a r-r-r-rock star,
 
mix you with the bass and drop ya!
Global!
 
My strobes glow like Chernobyl!
Kids explode and get mobile!
 
No one even knows you!
I make the whole world move! You play community theatre!
I gained your same fame from home on a blown out speaker!

Oh yes, I've heard that EP, and see I transcribed it here
Tell me, what comes after the 68th measure of diarrhea?
And what kind of drugs does it take to enjoy this? I've no idea!
I've seen more complexity in a couch from IKEA
You go piano to fortississimo, that means soft to very very loud
Cause I'm guessing that you didn't know!
Why don't you put down your Cubase & pick up a real bow?
I rocked harder than you when I was 5 years old!

WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EPIC RAP 
B-B-B-B-B-BATTLES!
