(I was born, I was born, I was born to lose)
(I was born, I was born, I was born to...)
Dark skies, deeper than the darkest kind
Take a little look inside
Redder than the reddest eyes
I can smell a white lie
Smaller than the smallest kind
I begin to hate myself
Acting like I feel just fine

Feeling got me feeling (x2)
I, I can tell
I was born
I was born to lose
I can tell
I was born
I was born to...
Don't cry
How we let it go this far
Look at what they do outside
Every time you close your eyes
Maybe you should go fight
Indifference of a different kind
Or you could always close your eyes
Acting like you feel just fine

Feeling got me feeling (x3)
Feeling got me feeling like I'm sinking again
I, I can tell
I was born
I was born to lose
I can tell
I was born
I was born to...
I'm born to lose
I'm born to
I'm born to lose
I have to
Now I'm thicker than a blood in the street
And I got a head start, still I'm tripping over my feet
And I'm on the parkway quicker now I'm feeling the heat
Cause I was born to lose
I'm born to lose (x2)
I'm born to
I'm born to lose
I have to
Dark skies, deeper than the darkest kind
Take a little look inside
Redder than the reddest eyes
Dark skies, always trying to pull me down
I can only shine so bright
Brighter at the darkest times
