I wanted to love you
I wanted to be with you
You wanted my heart to stop, stop feelin'
And you had this attitude
Ice cold, bulletproof
Couldn't shoot my l-love into you

If you're gonna do one thing, don't let go
If you're gonna cut my strings, cut them all
But don't leave me hangin' on

I don't know why you did me like this
I don't know why you ruined my bliss
But you keep me, keep me hangin' on
We were fine, just sitting sunkissed
Staring at your lips with your sweat so salted
We were young, we were young, and hangin' on
Just hangin' on, just hangin' on

I wanted to stop you
I wanted to run with you
You wanted me to stop, stop tryin'
To explain how difficult
It was to let you go
Can someone put a bullet through my head?

If you're gonna do one thing, don't let go
If you're gonna cut my strings, cut them all
But don't leave me hangin' on

I don't know why you did me like this
I don't know why you ruined my bliss
But you keep me, keep me hangin' on
We were fine, just sitting sunkissed
Staring at your lips with your sweat so salted
We were young, we were young, and hangin' on
Just hangin' on, just hangin' on

If you're gonna do one thing, don't let go
If you're gonna cut my strings, cut them all
But don't leave me hangin' on

I don't know why you did me like this
I don't know why you ruined my bliss
But you keep me, keep me hangin' on
We were fine, just sitting sunkissed
Staring at your lips with your sweat so salted
We were young, we were young, and hangin' on
Just hangin' on, just hangin' on

Just hangin' on, just hangin' on
