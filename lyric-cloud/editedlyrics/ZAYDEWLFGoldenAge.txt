I woke up this morning
The future was calling
And I can’t ignore it no more
I’ve got my dark side
But I see that sunshine
But I can’t just stand here no more

Like a chosen one
Like a chosen one
I was made to run
I was made to run

Don’t you know that we
Are living in a golden age
Don’t you know that we
Are living in a golden age

If I take each moment
Like I’m a poet
And make us feel something we miss
Laughing and crying
Live like we’re dying
And never look back at what if

Like a chosen one
Like a chosen one
I was made to run
I was made to run

Don’t you know that we
Are living in a golden age
Don’t you know that we
Are living in a golden age

These are the days that we know we’ve been given
Just breathe it in, breathe it out and keep living
I know it feels like the world don’t quit spinning
Just breathe it in, breathe it out and keep living

Golden age
We're living in this golden age
In a golden age
We're living in this golden age

Don’t you know that we
Are living in a golden age
Don’t you know that we
Are living in a golden age

These are the days that we know we’ve been given
Just breathe it in, breathe it out and keep living
I know it feels like the world don’t quit spinning
Just breathe it in, breathe it out and keep living

Living in a golden age
