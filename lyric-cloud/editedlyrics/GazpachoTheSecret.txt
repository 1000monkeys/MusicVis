Trembling her fingers through his soft graying hair
He barely noticed that she was there
The party has secrets
Toasting in vintage a man of the world
Her face is pale now mother of pearl
The party has secrets stark raving mad
What she's been hiding from them all these years
So far away now the moment is here
No one heard the thunder as he tumbled down the stairs
The party has secrets stark raving mad
And they say that he's a lunatic the marks are on her back
Short changed at the party
We all have secrets stark raving mad
