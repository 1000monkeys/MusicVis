Got a feeling like Winter
Got me feeling so cold
Got me reaching for my jacket
Shelter me from the storm
What happen to the summer days
Just a haze
We were so gonna fray
Got me feeling like winter

Can you melt me like ice, ice, ice, ice
On a hot summer day
But knock on my ice, ice, ice, ice
Don’t run away
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Don’t run away

Got a feelin like
Got a feelin like Winter
Got a feelin like
Got me feeling so cold

Can you melt me like ice, ice, ice, ice
On a hot summer day
But knock on my ice, ice, ice, ice
Don’t run away
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Don’t run away
Can you melt me like ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Don’t run away
