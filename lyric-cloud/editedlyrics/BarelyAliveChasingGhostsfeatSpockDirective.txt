I have it now
I fought hard and broke down the walls that stood for so long and
I've made it through
The hurdle will stand before me overcoming a free soul
Don't go chasing what's gone
Or else you won't know when to hang on
And I said it fast when I told you
You're not giving me what I want

Don't go chasing what's gone
Or else you won't know when to hang on
Don't go chasing what's gone
Or else you won't know
Don't go

Don't go chasing what's gone
Don't go chasing what's gone
Don't go chasing what's gone or else you
Don't go chasing what's gone
Don't go chasing what's gone
Don't go chasing what's gone or else you
Don't go chasing what's gone or else you
