It's my future, not a mystery
These games that you play, you're my history
Not your possession, you don't own me
Said it's all for the best, I disagree
Oh boy, what you gonna say?
When I walk away?
Got a mind to eliminate
Oh-oh boy
What you gonna do?
When I'm not with you?
I will show you another view

It's evolutional
Baby you should know
'Cause you gave me the keys
Then you let me go
Gonna make a change, gonna rearrange
Improve myself, I don't want your help
I'm gonna make you wanna stay (Oh oh)
I'm gonna make you wanna stay (Oh oh)

Used to build me up
Used to knock me down
Thought you were so clever?
Who's laughing now?
Are you listening?
Do I have your attention?
I'm telling you now I'm your final invention
Oh boy where you gonna go when you're all alone?
Such a shame you've been overthrown
Oh-oh boy what you gonna do when I'm not with you?
I will show you another view

It's evolutional
Baby you should know
'Cause you gave me the keys
Then you let me go
Gonna make a change, gonna rearrange
Improve myself, I don't want your help

Coulda had a good thing
Coulda been so evolutional
But if we can't be together, babe
Then I'm gonna make you wanna stay
Oh boy, what you gonna be
When you're not with me?
They call me catastrophe
Oh-oh boy what you gonna do
When I'm not with you?
I will show you another view

It's evolutional
Baby you should know
'Cause you gave me the keys
Then you let me go
Gonna make a change, gonna rearrange
Improve myself, I don't want your help

Coulda had a good thing
Coulda been so evolutional
But if we can't be together babe
Then I'm gonna make you wanna stay
I'm gonna make you wanna stay
I'm gonna make you wanna stay
