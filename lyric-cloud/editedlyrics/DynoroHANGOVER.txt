And I can drink until dawn, dawn
Got a hangover, oh
Grow up, up
And I can drink until dawn, dawn
Got a hangover, oh
I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted
And I can drink until dawn, dawn
Got a hangover, oh
Grow up, up
And I can drink until dawn, dawn
Got a hangover, oh
Ohhh
I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup pour me some more
I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup pour me some more
So I can go until dawn, dawn
Got a hangover, oh
Grow up, up
Drink until dawn, dawn
Got a hangover, oh
Oh grow up, oh
Go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on
I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup pour me some more
Go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on
