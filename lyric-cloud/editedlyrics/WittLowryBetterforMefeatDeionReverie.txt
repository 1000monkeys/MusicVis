Look, I brought your present back to Tiffany's, yeah, was for your birthday, before you
Hurt me the worst way, I wonder what's gettin' into me
I wonder if your drinks in his mouth tastin' like victory
I wonder why at night every lie still plays like a symphony, I
Can barely focus, you never cared, I was broken
Been hurtin' since my dad passed, bet you wouldn't have noticed
'Cause you were busy blacked out, stumblin', losin' focus
Surrounded by all that's hopeless in a life that you never chose, and
Here I go again, preachin' like I know who you are
Too busy stuck inside your phone to ever notice the stars
I miss the nights we'd sing Adele in your car
And had you wetter than the tears that you would cry when discussin' your scars
I know your demons carry weight, don't know what it's like to be you
Built myself from the bottom, don't know what it's like to need you
You lied from the beginning, don't know what it's like to read you
My dad passed away and that day I flew out to see you
Remember? I'm thinkin' back to December
And how we talked about forever, now we talk less than never
I can't lie, sometimes I find myself re-reading your letter
I'm not sayin' I was perfect, still, I wish I woulda treated you better

How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be…
On and on and on again, I fear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
And you don't know how many times
I forgive you, just so I could keep you by my side
I don't know why we waste our time
Spendin' all our nights in this gorgeous lie

Now maybe time was just against us, 'cause you had just been broken when I met ya
I tried to take your pieces, and put you all back together
But the truth is comin' out, I feel your void when we're together
Not sayin' that I was better, you drink to relieve the pressure
I know, let's keep it real
I know you loved to lie, but do you find you love me still?
'Cause he will never love you like I loved you, when I promise—that is real
You can delete all of our pictures, but you can't delete your feels
You should be easy to replace
But every meaningless conversation, I see your face
I'm tryna fill this hole in my heart that you fuckin' made, I'm trippin'
Should've known that I would never find my happiness in all of these women
I need to find it in myself, that's for damn sure
Almost been a year since I got you from the airport
Crazy how time flies, I'm tryin' to hold on while
I wait for your call like, "Come out at the bar!", at night, now, how could this be?

How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be…
On and on and on again, I fear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
And you don't know how many times
I forgive you, just so I could keep you by my side
I don't know why we waste our time
Spending all our nights in this gorgeous lie
