He hears mom and dad yellin', mom always wanted divorce
Dad calling momma a whore
Drunk, been drinking all weekend, a couple of Coors
A couple of doors were broke in, cover the floor, damn
He's always told never to tell
If anybody finds out, he'll be put in a cell
Hit with a belt, there will be nobody to help
And so he prays everyday while he's stuck in this hell
All to himself, he holds every ounce of it in
All the kids who have things always laughing at him
All the teachers see his pain, but he's playing pretend
Playing with friends is something he wishes he can
But nobody wants to give him a chance
Nobody wants to be with a man
Been looking at the future, but the future is so far in advance
Looking at the alcohol in his hand, like "Damn"

Like, "Why, why God? Why do I do this again, and
Why am I getting so drunk?
See, my dad was a drunk, I don't wanna be him, I
I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within, I"

I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna 
lose
 myself
Just to rule
The silicone kingdom with you-ou, with you-ou-ou
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to rule
The silicone kingdom with you-ou, with you-ou-ou

She goes to read another message—"Ho, slut, stupid and fake"
She doesn't know how much she can take
She's looking at her body, it's a body that she plans to replace—fake
Everything all over her face—fake
Smile leads up to her lashes
Never been asked about passion
Only been asked about passin' the blunt to the left
Or a pic of her chest, called a bitch and a mess, she's a wreck
Waiting for a text from a guy
Who'd tell her that he love her, but he wanna see her cry
Who'd tell her that he love her, but he beat her every night
With a pipe out of spite, she might leave him for a guy
With a tie and a job, a Mike or a Rob
She's tired and sobs on the knob of a door
Yellin' out, "Please, I can't take no more!"
And he's yellin' out, "Fuck you! You cunt, you whore!"
Damn, she doesn't wanna be on the news
Only 22, looking down the barrel of a .22
Looking for a move she can make
Looking at the bruise on her face, never felt safe
Never felt late 'til the end of the month
Looking down at her stomach like, "What have we done?"
I was looking for love and you were lookin' for fun
And now a life is in my body 'cause you wanted to cum

Like "Why, why God? Why do I do this again, and
Why am I thinking that we could find love inside lust?
See, we love to pretend, I
I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them by fucking with him
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within, I"

I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to rule
The silicone kingdom with you-ou, with you-ou-ou
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to rule
The silicone kingdom with you-ou, with you-ou-ou

He's addicted to the world's most dangerous drug
The one that'll make you lose everything that you love
And we don't understand, money doesn't buy love
So we pile up all our money just to buy us
A new car, some new rims, a new Benz
Doesn't have friends no more
An iPod, an iPad, an iMac
So rich that he's feeling poor
If he had one chance to go back
Wishes that he never bagged a whore
A couple more Coors and a broken door
Shattered decor all over the floor
Coming home at a quarter to four, coming home is a bore
Looking at a gin bottle, got a quarter to pour
At a local titty bar, he got a better rapport
No cover ones cover the floor, really looking for more
And more money makes more problems
He don't understand how to solve 'em
Doesn't understand his son and his wife are his life, every night
When they fight, now he's looking at 'em as a problem
That's a problem, now he doesn't know what to do
Out of touch, leaving town, every weekend or two
Thinking money maybe buy us all the happiness too
'Til he's sitting in a room, staring back at a .22
Like, "What happened to life?
I went so many years and I thought I was right
I went so many years, never livin' my life
And I'm scared that my son turns out just like
Me, why me, my God?
Everything I see really is a facade
Fake love, fake hair, fake nails, fake bod
We replace as a race and we try to play God"

Like "Why, why God, why do I do this again, and
Why am I getting so drunk?
See, my dad was a drunk, I don't wanna be him, I
I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin, I
I know we're thinking that we could find love inside lust
See, we love to pretend, I
I know a part of the problem
Is silicone kingdom we're living within
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all of my feelings within, I"

I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to rule
The silicone kingdom with you-ou, with you-ou-ou
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to rule
The silicone kingdom with you-ou, with you-ou-ou
