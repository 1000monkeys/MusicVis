If all I had was one last breath
I'd spend it just to sing your praise
Just to say your name
If all I had was one last prayer
I'd pray it 'cause I know you're always listening
If I could live a thousand lives, bind the hands of time
I would spend every moment by your side

Cause I, I know you're there, I know you see me
You're the air I breathe
You are the ground beneath me
I know you're there, I know you hear me
I can find you anywhere

If all I had was one more song to sing
I would raise a noise to make the heavens ring
If all I had was one last chance, I'd take it
I would stake it all on you
If I could rise up high and catch a glimpse of every eye
I would make them believe
What I feel inside

Cause I, I know you're there, I know you see me
You're the air I breathe
You are the ground beneath me
I know you're there, I know you hear me
I can find you anywhere

If I could live a thousand lives and bind the hands of time
If I could rise up high and catch a glimpse of every eye

I know you're there, I know you see me
You're the air I breathe
You are the ground beneath me
I know you're there, I know you hear me
I can find you anywhere
I know you're there
I know you're there
I know you're there, you're there
