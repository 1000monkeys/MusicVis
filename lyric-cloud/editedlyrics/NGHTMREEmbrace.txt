Don't wanna wait too long and miss the chance
Of getting you closer
Or when it gets colder, colder
Hold you, if everything around us breaks
Baby, we'll just fade to grey
Hold you, 'till everything is miles away
Lost in your embrace
Lost in your embrace

Oh, it all comes crashing down
I'm gonna be closer
I can only get stronger
Whenever it's over, whenever it's over

Hold you, if everything around us breaks
Baby, we'll just fade to grey
Hold you, 'till everything is miles away
Lost in your embrace
Lost in your embrace
