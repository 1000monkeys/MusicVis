So I may be lonely
Without you in my head
All I ever wanted
Was to be a different man

But I still make her cry
I love to make her cry

If I leave at sundown
I won't be home until dawn
I know it's hard to love me
But I miss you when I'm gone

I still make her cry
I love to make her cry
I still make her cry
Love to make you cry

I can't sleep, I'm restless
So I think about myself
If I weren't so selfish
I could hear your calls for help

But I still make her cry
I love to make her cry
But I still make her cry
Love to make you cry
