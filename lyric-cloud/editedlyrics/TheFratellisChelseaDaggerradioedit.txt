Owww!
Well you must be a girl
With shoes like that
She said, "You know me well"
I'll see you and
Little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel
Oh yeah
Someone said you was askin' after me
But I know you best as a blagger
I said "Tell me your name, is it Sweet?"
She said, "My boy, it's Dagger"
Oh yeah
I was good, she was hot
Stealin' everythin' she got
I was bold
She was over the worst of it
Gave me gear, thank you dear
Bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me
Just for the hell of it
Well you must be a boy
With bones like that
She said "You got me wrong"
I would've sold them to you
If I could've just have kept
The last of my clothes on
Oh yeah
Call me up
Take me down with you
When you go
I could be your regular belle
And I should dance
For little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel
Oh yeah
I was good, she was hot
Stealin' everythin' she got
I was bold
She was over the worst of it
Gave me gear, thank you dear
Bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me
Just for the hell of it
Chelsea, Chelsea, I believe
That when your dancin' slowly
Suckin' your sleeve
The boys get lonely
After you leave
It's one for the Dagger and
Another for the one you believe
Chelsea, I believe
That when your dancin' slowly
Suckin' your sleeve
The boys get lonely
After you leave
It's one for the Dagger
Another for the one you believe
One you believe
Oh, no, no, no, no
One you believe
