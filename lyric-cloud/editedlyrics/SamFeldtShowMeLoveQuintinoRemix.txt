I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one-night off faze
What I need is somebody
Who will always be there
Don't you promise me the world
World that I already
This time, call me baby
Actions speak louder than words
If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Come, my love is guaranteed

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you've got to show me love


If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Come, my love is guaranteed

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you've got to show me love
Show me
