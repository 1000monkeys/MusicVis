I know you see the hurt
If everything crashes, your eyes are where I feel safe

I know you see the hurt and the pain written on my face (Face)
Been thinkin' 'bout what you think about when you think about me (Me)
If everything crashes, your eyes are where I feel safe (Safe)
If all we have left is tonight, then I wanted to say

Yeah
Say no more, but tell me this (What?)
Can you taste the pain in me, on my lips?
Question when I saw your face was, "Who is this?"
I was shootin' for the stars and was shootin' from the hip
Just know that I would never change you
Bless the woman that made you
Bless the people who came around
When you were down and out and then saved you
Fuck the people who played you
Your wall is up, I don't blame you
I just want you to know your worth
And to love the way that God made you
Made you, and know
All I wanna do is be there for you through it all
Think about the nights when I would wait up for your call
My ex made me believe you can't trust anyone at all
It's funny how the more you build, the farther you can fall
When I had no money, we would eat and you would pay
Sorry if you ever felt I ever made you chase
Why you wasting time always starin' at your waist?
I just wanna trust you, love you more now every day

We're at this diner that we found
Somewhere between then and now
When I ask you if you want jam for your toast, ha
You spent the night the other day
So many things I could say
Instead I just shy away and I choke, ugh
And I'm supposed to be a poet
So open with my emotions
And all I can ask about is your toast, hehe
I guess I'm glad you didn't leave
'Cause you make me a better me
And you'll see the Mark no one sees when I'm low, so

I know you see the hurt and the pain written on my face (Face)
Been thinkin' 'bout what you think about when you think about me (Me)
If everything crashes, your eyes are where I feel safe (Safe)
If all we have left is tonight, then I wanted to say

Yeah!
Now after seasons of talking and watching night turn to morning
And telling stories a second time when you feel they're important
The love I have for you is rare, I was just scared 'cause it's foreign
That had me thinking, "Should I stop or shoot my shot like I'm Gordon?"
And still I flashback to the crash that could've ended we
The glass smashed somewhere past that's when you said to me
"You'll be alright," thought if I'm not then I'll pretend to be
I'm thankful every day you found your way and then was lead to me
We're bloody and bruised, assessing our wounds
Airbag in my face, you can't find your shoes
In shock and I'm sad, in pain and I'm mad
Look down at my stomach, all I'm seeing is black, ugh

Lights from the back, they're blue and they're red
The guy who hit us never was found, just left us for dead
A million things I wish I could say that never were said
I'm sorry if I'm here but not here, got lost in my head
A million things I wish I could do to show you I care
Just know when you feel empty and scared, I'll always be there
Don't care 'bout how much money you make or clothes that you wear
I care 'bout memories that we make and time that we share
Let's keep it real, it's hard for me to trust, they all went fake on me
I hope you keep it real and never change on me
You tell me when it's heavy, put that weight on me
On me (On me), on me, so

I know you see the hurt and the pain written on my face (Face)
Been thinkin' 'bout what you think about when you think about me (Me)
If everything crashes, your eyes are where I feel safe (Safe)
If all we have left is tonight, then I wanted to sâ€”
