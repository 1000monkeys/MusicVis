Well I know it gets harder every single day
And I know my darkness will never go away

It's hard when you're living and you don't feel much
And you're down and you're hoping that things are gonna change

Oh, we don't know the roads that we're heading down
But we all know if we're lost, then we'll find a way
We don't know if we leave, will we make it home
But we all know, if there's hope, then we'll be okay

And some say it gets brighter
We just have to wait
Mother, mother, I can feel your heart break
Burning through me every single day

It's hard when you're living and you don't feel much
And you're down and you're hurting 'cause you don't feel loved
It's hard when you're living and you don't feel much
And you're down and you're hoping that things are gonna change

Oh, we don't know the roads that we're heading down
But we all know if we're lost, then we'll find a way
We don't know if we leave, will we make it home
But we all know, there's hope and we'll be okay
Oh, we don't know the roads that we're heading down
But we all know if we're lost, then we'll find a way
We don't know if we leave, will we make it home
But we all know, if there's hope, then we'll be okay

Oh, there's something in my mind that's killing me
There's something that this life's not giving me
Would you say
There's something in my mind that's killing me
There's something that this life's not giving me
Would you say

Oh, we don't know the roads that we're heading down
But we all know if we're lost, then we'll find a way
We don't know if we leave, will we make it home
But we all know, if there's hope, then we'll be okay
Oh, we don't know the roads that we're heading down
But we all know know if we're lost, then we'll find a way
We don't know if we leave, will we make it home
But we all know, if there's hope, then we'll be okay
