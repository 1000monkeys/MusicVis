This story's dark like the place where this story starts
Full of fiends, and gangsters with gory hearts
Drugged-up girls dressed up like naughty tarts
Performing sex, and perverted forms of art
And anybody with a fantasy that needs fulfilling
Even the filth, cops that lock up man for stealing
For Quent, there bent, sweat dripping off the ceiling
Sadomasochists, who need to quench their thirst for beatings
Anything goes when you've got the riches
But only the sexually depraved pay for pregnant bitches
Her name's Katya, yours to do what you wish with
If you're into chicks that wake up with morning sickness
And have to make their way past people fucking
Punters hooked on hookers hooked on smack, cluckin
Spent a day getting touched up and butt-fucking
Wishing she'd wake up from the nightmare she was stuck in
But she weren't waking up from nothing, this was her reality
Place where dreams come true for those who lack morality
She had to get out, if not for her child, for her sanity
Cause the only difference between this place and hell was gravity

You want the business? (runaway, runaway)
Want the money man?
You want the business?
You want the business, the business, the money man?
You want the business? (runaway, runaway)
Want the money man?
You want the business?
You want the business, the business, the money man?

It was a weird twist of fate, the way that she escaped
She knew her chance would come, she just had to wait
'till one of her abductors made a mistake
Mixing vodka with heart pills and smoking a straight
With the door unlocked, ain't the smartest idea
When your runnings are illegal and your cargo live in fear
The path was now clear, but only for a exit
Cause the road ahead was long, and full of unexpected
Twists and turns, she learned inadvertently
How to cope with life's little moments of uncertainty
Feeling safe on the street, however absurd it seems
The mother and baby unit, where she had disturbing dreams
Was a place she didn't feel was safe and had to leave
Would only be a matter of time before she had police
Asking her questions, finding out the truth
About her underworld connections, sending her back
To the brothel, either that, 
or simply just deporting her
She's met corrupted law before, she can't see them supporting her
So if she goes along the road, it slowly starts destroying her
Not knowing where she's going, or why God just keeps ignoring her


Life was hard in the brothel, now it's hard in the street
Cause English is a language she can hardly speak
Like so many Eastern European people you meet
Only difference is they're legal and they're earning their keep
She was smuggled into Britain almost four months gone
She didn't know she was pregnant 'till they saw the bump
And now the baby's here and they're both on the run
If she don't beg, steal and borrow, she ain't no kind of mum
Stealings a vicious circle, with a big set of teeth
The sharper they are, the smarter the thief
So now she's broke again and don't even know it
Until she reaches for the purse and that ain't hers cause she stole it
To find it ain't there, I guess you reap what you sow
It's a bitch how karma works, it's hard to work out where she's going
Resorting back to prostitution when the traffic is flowing
Her ride stops and drives off when it sees what she's towing
Must be hard knowing that you're nothing but a peasant
Game for the hunters to pray on you like pheasants
Loitering at bus-stops like bored adolescents
With sex on their mind, cause you give off the impression
That you'd sell yourself for money, not find the thought repellent
Getting fucked in the field from behind, while you breastfeed your child
Just so it don't cry, it's unpleasant
But that's what she did and now we're back in the present

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
