Back in Colorado, baby
Seventeen years, we were childish playing
We had time to make good nights
We push back all our problems daily
Polaroid shots in the mountains, baby
We had time to make good nights

And we were high
We had radio love
We said we'd never ever, ever let it go, no
In our mirage
We were perfect as fuck
Making dreams about our lives up in the stars
Yeah yeah babe
Yeah yeah babe

And don't you ever go, don't you ever go, darling
'Cause you're all that I know, you're all that I know
Why did you change your mind and end the night?
And now I'm on my own, now I'm on my own
Maybe I'll call you on the phone, call you on the phone
Or maybe I just won't call 'cause I'm alright
Yeah yeah babe

Someday I'll be patient, baby
Maybe our minds wouldn't be that hazy
We'd have time to make good nights
Look back through our rearview mirror
Saturday lights couldn't get much clearer
We'd have time to make good nights

And we were high
We had radio love
Said we never ever, ever let it go, no
In our mirage
We were perfect as fuck
Faking dreams about our lives up in the stars
Yeah yeah babe
Yeah yeah babe

And don't you ever go, don't you ever go, darling
'Cause you're all that I know, you're all that I know
Why did you change your mind and end the night?
And now I'm on my own, now I'm on my own
Maybe I'll call you on the phone, call you on the phone
Or maybe I just won't call 'cause I'm alright

Oh, I feel the days
I feel the nights in every way
You break me down
Your perfect lines, they fall easy
Oh, I feel the days
I feel the nights in every way
But maybe our good nights have faded fast
