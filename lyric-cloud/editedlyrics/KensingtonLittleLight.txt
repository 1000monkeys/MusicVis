Going out on a weekday
Hoping on the collide with a soul that
Knows a heart from a lie when you show it
Sees a heart in the lie that you show
I’ll deny all the weak play
Not a style that I take any pride in
But the greed of my mind isn’t going
All the greed of my mind isn’t going away
Have some
But I’ll be taking it all again
Yeah, I’ll be taking it all
And on my way
And on my way
I wanted it all

Hey, I can see a little light here
Know that I’m ready to fight
Oh, but I’ll run and I’ll hide again
Hey, I can see a little light there
Know I should get up and try
Oh, but I’m better at hiding it

Going out on a weekday
Knowing all of my pride will dissolve in
All the seeds of my mind that are growing
Oh, the seed of my mind isn’t going away
Have some
But I’ll be taking it all again
Yeah, I’ll be taking it all
And on my way
And on my way
I wanted it all

Hey, I can see a little light here
Know that I’m ready to fight
Oh, but I’ll run and I’ll hide again
Hey, I can see a little light there
Know I should get up and try
Oh, but I’m better at hiding it

When I’ll wait
For the dueling to get a little cold again
Then no one but I will know me
When all of my light ends
When I’ll wait
For the dueling to get a little cold again
Then no one but I will know me
When all of my light ends

When I'll wait
I can see a little light here
Know that I’m ready to fight
Oh, but I’ll run and I’ll hide again
When I'll wait
I can see a little light there
Know I should get up and try
Oh, but I’m better at hiding it
