I sneak up and hit you like a fucking tornado
You ain't no operator
So who the fuck are you then?
I sneak up and hit you like a fucking tornado
If you don't hit those faders
I won't ever stop
I sneak up and hit you like a fucking tornado
With a- To the-
And a- With the-
I sneak up and hit you
Like a fucking tornado
You ain't no operator
You ain't no operator

I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be pretty
