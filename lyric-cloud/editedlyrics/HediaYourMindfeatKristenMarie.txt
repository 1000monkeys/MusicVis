La la lee, la la la (x3)
La la lee lee lee lee

Do you wanna know
What skin to skin feels like?
At three in the morning
When the beat feels right
Don't be a fool
I can make you come alive
If you're ready, get set, let's go
Do you wanna know
What heart to heart feels like?
Alone in the dark
But the beat feels nice
Taste the fire of a better life
I can give you everything you want
La la lee, la la la (x4)

Baby, I can feel
Feel your desperation
Unleash all your fear
Let me be your motivation
Let's grind to the beat
Of our burning bodies
I-I-I can read your mind


And babe I know you want
For me to take you under
This is not a front
I wanna be your lover
Come and take a taste
There is no going back now
Don't let it go to waste
You do not need to ask how
I-I-I can read your mind
(I can read your mind)
(I can read your mind)
La la lee, la la la (x4)

All I wanna do
Can't you even give it a chance?
All I wanna do
Is simply to dance with you
(Is simply to dance with you)

La la lee, la la la (x8)
