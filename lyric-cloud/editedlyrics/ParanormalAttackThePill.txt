You told me to meet you here
But I couldnÂ´t get in
I was told you were dancing
And your hands were everywhere
Did you know her
Is she a friend
I know you know the door man
Did you tell him not to let me in
I see how thing go now
You just use me for my thrills
Go ahead and keep on dancing
HAHAHA!!! Cause I got the Pill
