I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favourite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's comin'
Forever fascinatin'
Hope you don't stop runnin'
To me 'cause I'll always be waitin'
You are - My cinema
I could watch you forever (watch you forever)
Action - Thriller
I could watch you forever (watch you forever)
You are - My cinema
A Hollywood treasure (Hollywood treasure)
Love you - Just the way you are
My cinema - My cinema

Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growin'
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessin'
Forever my wonder
Hope you start undressin'
All my dreams and take me under
You are - My cinema
I could watch you forever (watch you forever)
