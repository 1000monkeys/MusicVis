I didn't come from much, but I had a head of gold and dreams
I did it for myself, I didn't know what love could mean
Cause I was always such a runaway
I had my alibis and my stowaways
But when I met you I couldn't get away

You showed me how to love like a spark in the night
And not be afraid (Oooooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)

Trying to cheat my way right through the game
But when you touched me, I couldn't get away
I have been through pain in the dark like a knife
Yeah, I've been betrayed (Oooooooh)
You showed me how to love like a spark in the night
And not be afraid (Oooooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Call me a liar, but there's hope in my wires
I keep takin the chance, rolling the dice in the heat of the fire
I am alive, yeah, cause you took me higher
I got mistakes I shouldn't have made but we are still Brave!
 (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
I have been through pain in the dark like a knife
Yeah, I've been betrayed (Oooooooh)
You showed me how to love like a spark in the night
And not be afraid (Oooooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
You taught me how to be Brave! (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
You taught me how to be ...
