Please come with me cat like you are me
Or I will hate you before it's go away
Latio I want to have a cat like him
Like Mr. Stampy Cat when I'm with him
Dancing at the nightclub tonight
Before it get complicated
I want to see it before the sunrise
Run it out before now
Let's defeat Hit The Target
Come with me Mr. Stampy Cat
This is your lovely musical score
Stampy's lovely musical score
This is a musical score for you
Boom that I did it
You can put me in the love garden
Your dogs are cute, and your cat
Sorry Lee left you but I want him to come back
Stampy Come with me
Hey you, yes I am talking to you
Do you want to talk for a sec
Are you L for Lee (yes me)
Can you come back to the cat (no)
Why don't you want you (beauce)
(OK, you are just a banjo bear clone!)
