Party like a monster pp party like a monster
You can be the coolest monster in class but that won't get you no pass
Even the popular's got problems you know
That doesn's mean that things won't try to tear you down
It's the way of life as the living dead i thought you know this by now
We're all just ghouls at the end of the day howling at the moon won't you come out and play play play
We're all just ghouls at the end of the day and we're breaking thru like zombies coming out of the grave
I like to party like a monster, party like a monster
Under the moon we just spooking around
Party like a monster, party like a monster
It's celebration pump your fists and get loud
How we get together
Make it last forever
We're stopping never
Party like a monster, party like a monster
Yeah! we go all night to the morning goblins young wild and free i need a monster just like medusa one look will make 'em all freeze we live inside of yo nightmares
I might scare you make me lose control it's unusual to me walking dead but make it look so bootiful
Put ya hands up and rock it loud pump ya first and let's scream and howl
Let's freak'em out
Up and down as we jump around jump, jump, jump, jump
Ghouls and gals know how to get down
Haunted house party under ground
Do it just like the monsters ownnn
Party like a monster, party like a monster
Under the moon we just spooking around
Party like a monster, party like a monster
It's a celebration pump your fists and get loud
How we get together
Make it last forever
We're stopping never
Party like a monster, party like a monster
Party like a monster
