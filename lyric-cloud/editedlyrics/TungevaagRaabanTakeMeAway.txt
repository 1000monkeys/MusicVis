Take me away
I will live my life like this is my last day
Take me away
Take me away
I am aiming for the stars cause I can't stay
Take me away

I've been dreaming of oceans
Places where nothing's broken
So far away
Up and over the mountains
Beyond rivers and deep ends
I'm on my way

Don't slow me down
Tell me where the love is
Tell me where to find it
I've been holding on
To something that I should've left long ago

Take me away
I will live my life like this is my last day
Take me away
Take me away
I am aiming for the stars cause I can't stay
Take me away

Fall asleep by an oak tree
Only nature surrounds me
Could this be real?
Lay me down where the sun sets
And I'll feel no more regrets
Finally free

Don't slow me down
Tell me where the love is
Tell me where to find it
I've been holding on
To something that I should've left long ago

Take me away
I will live my life like this is my last day
Take me away
Take me away
I am aiming for the stars cause I can't stay
Take me away
(One, two‚ three‚ four)
(Hey!)
