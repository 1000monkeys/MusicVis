(True love can't be big enough)
(True love can't be big enough, believe)

Clouds in the summer
'Cause this ain't a perfect world
But if your eyes are open
You'll see just what it's worth
Rebels are runnin'
And they don't wanna see it burn
But we could run together
'Cause I see you and I feel your hurt

If you wake up it's a good day
We poppin' a bottle tonight, so you should stay
We might only have one night, so I wanna say

Every soul is golden
Every heart's an ocean
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough
Every soul is golden
Every heart's an ocean
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough, believe

True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough, believe

On the highway, (?)
And music still in my car
'Cause the week's been so so
But the weekend ain't that far
Rebels are runnin'
And they don't wanna see it burn
But we could run together
'Cause I see you and I feel your hurt

If you wake up it's a good day
We poppin' a bottle tonight, so you should stay
We might only have one night, so I wanna say

Every soul is golden
Every heart's an ocean
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough
Every soul is golden
Every heart's an ocean
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough

True love
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough
True love, oh
It's true love, believe
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough

True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough
True love can't be big enough
No, true love can't be big enough, believe
