Sweet sweat on my bones
Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let's just forget reputations
Let's just forget reputations
Red cheeks, read your mind
They tell me what you wanna do
Let me take you on this vacation
Let me take you on this vacation

Oh stop what you're doing right now
You better watch me, you better watch me

Take a look at this
Step back
Take a look at this
You can free your mind
You can free it free it
You can free your mind
Yeah you can free your mind
Take a look at this

Seat back windows down
Just tell me where you wanna go
Leave behind your reservations
Leave behind your reservations
California skies
Always get you off the ground
Let go with no hesitation
Let go with no hesitation

Oh stop what you're doing right now
You better watch me, you better watch me

Take a look at this
Step back
Take a look at this
You can free your mind
You can free it free it
You can free your mind
Yeah you can free your mind
Take a look at this

Let me show you
Let me show you what I've got
Let me show you
Let me show you what I've got

Oh stop what you're doing right now
You better watch me, you better watch me

Take a look at this
Step back
Take a look at this
You can free your mind
You can free it free it
You can free your mind
Yeah you can free your mind
Take a look at this
