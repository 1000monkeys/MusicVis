Yo, original pattern and settings
You know my style when I step in
Find a one space in the corner
Get ready for the kuff kwaff kweffing
Day one, I'm L-O-N-D-O-N repping
Black bandana when I'm out here shelling
System killer's in the bloodclart building
I don't want no one forgetting
It's a horror show when my team roll out
Grime ting, I never ever sold out
A lot of them MCs weren't doing grime any more
'Til Skepta made the place Shutdown
That's not me 'cause I've always been a dumpers
Du-rag has always done numbers
Anybody saying that grime don't sell or won't last
Tell them they're talking nonsense

Flying, I'm back where I wanna be
I set the pace like wallabys
Man know I pepper the riddim just like Chip
Man know I skip on the riddim just like Skib
Original Raggamuffin just like Pip
Once a wise man gave me a tip, yo
It was on how to get money
Since then I ain't never stopped getting money
It's Wiley and Flow, Campbell Road
We've got the draws yeah, we've got the Oz
Yo, we've got the right creps on
Call on any street that I've stepped on
Rah, them can't see me
Man say I'm washed up, I say "Oh really?"
Go get your likkle two bars out, have your two minutes
Then pass the torch back to me, really

Dungeon
L-O-N-D-O-N, London
Show me the money for the function
Man will light up your skin with shells in abundance
Quick ting, man ah move rapid
Fix tings like a mechanic
Old school, man-a-man are classic
They already know man, don't need to gas it
Number one flow farda on the planet
So I beg a man try and do damage
That's something I let the dogs manage
Clart one, get away and then vanish
Day one, I told them no violations
Cah none of them ain't gonna have it
It don't take much for the friends and family
To get man ah start moving savage
