 (x4)
Now I'm complicated, you won't get me I have trouble

In a dark room, we fight
Make up for, our love
I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you
'Bout us
And we're moving, slow
Our hearts beat, so fast
I've been dreaming, dreaming 'bout you
'Bout us

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, and oh

Were speaking, soft
See the pain in, your eyes
I've been feelin', feelin' for you, my love
And our bodies, are tied
Our shadows, will dance
I've been achin', achin' for you, my love


My love is wasted, sorry for this, I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves and I'm
Complicated, you won't get me, I have trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself
