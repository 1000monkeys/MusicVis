Stumbling through the dark with a broken heart
All alone at it once again
Seeping in like a feeling
You haven't felt since way back when
In the dead of that night, like the summer of Sam
I caught word of the commotion you caused via telegram
And got all worked up
We got all worked up
I found away
Over the fear and through the flames
I'm diving in, don't follow me
Stay right here, I'll be back for you someday
I found away
It'd be best if you just stayed
It's not safe, don't follow me
I found away, I found away
Frozen in the lights of a locomotive
Tied to the tracks again
You said you haven't felt this comatose
Since you can't remember when
Fly off the handle every time we sleep
Straight off the deep
I found away
Over the fear and through the flames
I'm diving in, don't follow me
Stay right here, I'll be back for you someday
I found away
It'd be best if you just stayed
It's not safe, don't follow me
I found away, I found away
From the top of my lungs
The truth shall be sung
Sharp and damning
Violently stabbing at secrecy
That look on your face
It's more than I can take
It's scaring
The living hell straight out of me
I found away
Over the fear and through the flames
I'm diving in, don't follow me
Stay right here, I'll be back for you someday
I found away
It'd be best if you just stayed
It's not safe, don't follow me
I found away, I found away
