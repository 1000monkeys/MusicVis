I've been thinkin'
little too much,
Walk in circles
oh, can still ask,
Can't be thinkin'
anymore no-ow
yeee-eeeeaah
Got me drinkin'
up here all night,
All these bright lights
hittin' my eyes,
Got me thinkin'
thinkin' too mu-uch

Look at me too late to lean out
I'll be here 'till the lights are out,
Go round and rou-ow-ow-ow-ow
Go round and rou-ow-ow-ow-ow
Feels like there's something in the night
there's only one thing on my mind,
Can't help it now-ow-ow-ow-ow
Can't help it now-ow-ow-ow-ow
Before I fuck it up

Little Darilin',
Little hideout,
Did you think I
wouldn't find out
about us thinkin'
open your eyes
yea-yea-yeaaaaa
Aaand I've been drinkin'
you know too mu-uch,
No without me
he can't love you, right,
Little Darilin'
Why do you keep comin' over?

Look at me too late to lean out
I'll be here 'till the lights are out,
Go round and rou-ow-ow-ow-ow
Go round and rou-ow-ow-ow-ow
Feels like there's something in the night
there's only one thing on my mind,
Can't help it now-ow-ow-ow-ow
Can't help it now-ow-ow-ow-ow
Before I fuck it up

I quit thinkin' 'bout it to-onight
I've been thinkin' 'bout it too much
Right before he was all mine, all this time
Now he's (comin' for me?)
I quit thinkin' 'bout it to-onight
I've been thinkin' 'bout it too much
Don't you remember...
You were all mine, all this time
please don't go-o nowhere
Before I fuck it up
