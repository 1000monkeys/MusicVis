How in the world can I explain?
When the words leap off from the page
Is there a way to celebrate?
When I'm scared straight from the past parades

The kids are throwing all their charms
At the latest token victory march
With no more trails to blaze

This is not connection
It's only an impression

How in the world can I compete?
When they're plugged into the new machines
Laser-focused on the screens
That will deliver them their self esteem

Well, their ears all ring in monotone
With their bodies snug in memory foam
I can't help it
I wanna hear them scream

This is not connection
It's only an impression

Plug on in, plug on in
Plug on in, plug on in
Plug on in, plug on in
Plug on in, plug on in
Plug on in

This is not connection
This is not affection
It's only an impression
This is not connection
