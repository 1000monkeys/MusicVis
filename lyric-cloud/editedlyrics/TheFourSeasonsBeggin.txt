Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

(Beggin') beggin' (You)
Put your loving hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby

Riding high when I was king
Played it hard and fast
'Cause I had everything
You walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Begging) beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby

I need you to understand
That I tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
Used to be
Shadow of my life
Is hanging over me
Broken man without a throne
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
