Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
Through urban fields
And suburban life

Turn the crowd up now
We’ll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on prime time
Turn up the love now
Listen up now
Turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world tonight
Who's gonna bring you back to life
We’re gonna make it you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
Who's gonna save-
Who's gonna bring-
We're gonna make it you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

We're far from home
It's for the better
What we dream
It’s all that matters
We’re on our way, united

Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on prime time
Turn up the love now
Listen up now
Turn up the love

Who’s gonna save the world tonight
Who's gonna bring you back to life
We're gonna make it you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
Who’s gonna save-
Who's gonna bring-
We're gonna make it you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
