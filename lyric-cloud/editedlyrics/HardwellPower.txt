I'll fill you up with bones that can never break
Take you to a darker shade of grey
Warm you like a sun that will never fade
Oooh, ooh

This is power, This is power
This is power, This is power, power, power
Power
This is power, This is power
This is power, This is power, power, power

I'll give you every heart of a hundred souls
You could be the fire to kill the cold
I'll break you like a rock that could never hold
Oooh, ooh

This is power, This is power
This is power, This is power, power, power
This is power, power, power

Power
This is power, This is power
This is power, This is power, power, power
