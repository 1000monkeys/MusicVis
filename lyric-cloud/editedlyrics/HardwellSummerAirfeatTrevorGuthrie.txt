Feel the sun on your skin
Feel the love sinking in
Oh, babe, what we waitin' for?
We got nothing to do
You got me, I got you
Oh, feel the sun on your skin
Feel the love sinking in
Say, babe, what we waitin’ for?
And no place I'd rather be
I got you, you got me

It's going off, I swear
We got it all right here

There must be something in that summer air
Just high on life and we don’t care
There must be something in that summer air
So high and we don't care
There must be something in that summer air
Just high on life and we don't care
There must be something in that summer air
So high and we don't care, that summer air

Feel the sun on your skin
Feel the love sinking in
Oh, babe, what we waitin' for?
We got nothing to do
You got me, I got you
Oh, feel the sun on your skin
Feel the love sinking in
Say, babe, what we waitin' for?
And no place I'd rather be
I got you, you got me

It's going off, I swear
We got it all right here

There must be something in that summer air
Just high on life and we don’t care
There must be something in that summer air
So high and we don’t care
There must be something in that summer air
Just high on life and we don't care
There must be something in that summer air
So high and we don’t care, that summer air

That summer air

There must be something in that summer air
Just high on life and we don't care
There must be something in that summer air
So high and we don't care

That summer air
