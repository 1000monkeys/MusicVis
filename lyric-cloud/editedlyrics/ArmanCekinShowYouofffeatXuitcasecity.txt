Tonight I'm gonna show what you've been missing
I'm sorry I don't pay you no attention
Tonight I'ma show you off, off, off
Tonight I'ma show you off, off, off
Tonight I'm gonna show what you've been missing
I'm sorry I don't pay you no attention
Tonight I'ma show you off, off, off
Tonight I'ma show you off, off, off

Okay now, hop up in that Rover
And pretend like I'm your chauffeur
Windows down, blasting music louder when we rolling
Flying out on private, take that jet down to the islands
MIA, show you off on Lambos out on Collins, I'll be-


Red dress with them heels on
We've been at it like so long
Just pop a bottle, get so gone
This champagne I'm sipping is so strong
In a Rolls-Royce, the destination is your choice
Make you feel like it's prom night
Cameras flashing like all night
Yeah, my girl, she look alright
Sad face, that be alright
You held your back
I can't believe that you fell for that
Telling me he came up short
Now I gotta make up for it
So used to being lied to
Saying that he love her, but he never showed it
Always saying that he giving money
Give it to the bank, but he never blow it
There's somebody who'll make the soil
Then plant the seed, and help him grow it

Okay now, hop up in that Rover
And pretend like I'm your chauffeur
Windows down, blasting music louder when we rolling
Flying out on private, take that jet down to the islands
MIA, show you off on Lambos out on Collins, I'll be-
