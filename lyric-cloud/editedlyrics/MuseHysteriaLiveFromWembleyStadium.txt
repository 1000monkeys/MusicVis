Yeah it's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out

Cause I want it now
And I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

Yeah It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
Yeah yeah yeah yeah


And I want you now
I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode
