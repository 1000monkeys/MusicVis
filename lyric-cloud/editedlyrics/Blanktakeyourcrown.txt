(Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah)

I don’t know how to stop apologising
When I’ve been reminded my whole life
The fault is mine
Every time I think I’m doing fine
Somebody move the goalposts out of line
Reason got no... ha
I can’t tell the time
Now it’s fight or flight
Danger ain’t arrived
I can’t tell what tense I’m in, but I know it’s heavy
Days fly by when I’m happy
But they go half-speed when I ain’t alright
And now I’m left and now I’m wrong
And I can’t breathe
I only see the outlines of the sunshine
Like an eclipse living up in my mind
Bittersweet that I know what’s behind
But I’m running and my legs got no stride, oh strife
But a knife need to be sharper
I ain’t Ron like I ain’t Harper
On my Bull shit, carry these chips
For a long time... for a long time
I ain’t got enough fingers to count
Every time that they counting me out
Take a left on this roundabout
But I’m still on my way around
Swimming in circles
But I ain’t no shark
Blood in the water when I run this bath
Don’t believe in god so why do I still feel like prey
When I’m all alone and it’s after dark
I’m in the park
And they’re all around
It ain’t god I found
But I know when I make it through the night
“Amen!” is what I shout, yeah

Balloons will fly as high as high
Apologies likes clouds, my tears can fly
They all fall back, I don't know why
What more can I expect, staying inside my fault lines?

(Yeah) I open up my arms to catch a cold
They bring you flowers to your funeral
But never bring you soup, a super bowl
But score a field goal, put it in the end zone
They gonna tell you that they were there
The interference as you ran
Right beside you, you unaware
The light that guides you, but it’s hot air
Is it hot here?
The gas in on, dear
A thousand yard stare
A flight of stairs (ha)
11 to be exact (yeah)
Lemon to be extract
A sour taste in a patch (yeah)
Put my brain in a cycle
Wash it clean, now the slate is blank
A colour spectrum and you chose black
A star will try to keep its brightness intact
When you stand forward do they hold you back?
Carry your smile but they drop acts
When your self-worth cannot pay them back
They assign you society’s rank
When you a king, yeah, they make you wear hats
Take your crown and remind you that
No, you ain’t nothing, but they subtract that
That’s the fact that
It’s hard to track back
You leave some breadcrumbs
But they’re just bait snacks
And you can’t trace jack
And now it’s ransom
Or random fake facts
Fuck em all

Balloons will fly as high as high
Apologies likes clouds, my tears can fly
They all fall back, I don't know why
What more can I expect, staying inside my fault lines?
Staying inside my fault lines
