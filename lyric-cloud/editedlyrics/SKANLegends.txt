Yo Skan, they been waiting on this, I ain't mean to go and get 'em all pissed
Take shots, I ain't scared if I miss, everybody gon' hear about this
I'ma get a 100 racks of an album, laugh in your face like Shaq when you foul him
Everybody want rap, they be willing, back in the game now my stats, they be piling
I'ma kick it off top for a minute, beast mode with the flow, can't stop, I'm winning
Live by the sword, die by the sword  tripping, you don't even get this life we living
Never gonna die then before I wake, I pray to the lord my soul to takе
Everybody wanna hate, they hold no wеight, why the weakest ones got the most to say?

Ahh
Mhh, ohh
(They could never rule me)

I pave my own way and I write my stories
Looking at the sky, not the men before me
Fuck the guidelines, they could never rule me
They could never rule me

We shall not retreat till we get the glory
Never back down, they gon' hear the story
Legends never die so they bow before me
We shall not retreat till we get the glory

Till we get the glory
They could never rule me
