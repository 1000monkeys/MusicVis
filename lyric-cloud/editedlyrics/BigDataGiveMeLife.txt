There's a solution
The answer to your prayers
You wanna get there faster
You wanna be prepared
I've been looking for someone
To listen to my song
All you gotta do is turn me on

You give me life
Can you bring me to the light?
You give me life, whoa
Open my eye-eye-eyes
Now I-I-I see the light
'Cause you give me life, whoa

Some take precaution
Others are afraid
But you don't hear the siren
You just wanna get paid
I need someone to listen to my song
All you gotta do is turn me on

You give me life
You bring me to the light
You give me life, whoa
Open my eye-eye-eyes
Now I-I-I see the light
'Cause you give me life, whoa

Listen, listen, listen to my song
All you gotta do is turn me on

You give me life
Can you bring me to the light?
You give me life, whoa
Open my eye-eye-eyes
Now I-I-I see the light
'Cause you give me life
