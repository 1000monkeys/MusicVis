At the moment I’m gaining some steam
A stranger arrives and knocks on my door
He congratulates me and suggests
That I should let him come and sit aboard

New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce
New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce

For years I was broke
My life was a joke
And I don’t recall you helping
I fought every day
Clawed back from the grave
That whole time where were you

New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce
New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce

Oh, the hype trains taking off
That was the final stop
We’ll run it til we’re out of track
I’m done with all the cons
I’m done with all the frauds
Done with all the imposters

At the moment I’m gaining some steam
A stranger arrives and knocks on my door
He congratulates me and suggests
That I should let him come and sit aboard

New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce
New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce

'Cause I’ve been low before
And I know, I’ll be low again
All aboard while we descend
Who’s down to ride?

New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce
New life, who dis?
I don’t reminisce
