Go break a leg
Making all your decisions on the back of a coin now
I know you're out to get
Your own vision of a city if you get it right
So go say what you wanna and go do what you wanna
I told you what i want
Its a shock if it isn't a let down
Call me what you wanna, do with me what you wanna
You know what i want and i want you to stay around
Its all up to you any way you put it
Its all up to you anyway
Go run away
Slamming doors at yourself cause you can't find a way out
I know you're too far in, setting off all your rights to put it down
So go say what you wanna and go do what you wanna
I told you what i want
Its a shock if it isn't a let down
Call me what you wanna, do with me what you wanna
You know what i want and i want you to stay around
Its all up to you any way you put it
Its all up to you anyway
And you know what i want love i told ya
So give me what i want love won't ya
And you know what i want love i told ya
So give me what i want love won't ya
