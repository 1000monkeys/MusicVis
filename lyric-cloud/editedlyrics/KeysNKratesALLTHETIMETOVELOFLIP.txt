I Want You To Breath All This Air

And I Gotta Stay High All The Time
And I Gotta Stay High All The Time
And I Gotta Stay High All The Time
To Keep You Off My Mind
Woah-Oh
I Want You To Breath All This Air With Me

And I Gotta Stay

Staying In My Play Pretend
Where The Fun Ain't Got No End
Woah-Oh
Can't Go Home Alone Again
Need Someone To Numb The Pain.
You're Gone And I Gotta Stay High All The Time

And I Gotta Stay High All The Time
And I Gotta Stay High All The Time
And I Gotta Stay High All The Time
To Keep You Off My Mind
