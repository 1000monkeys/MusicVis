Riding off to the sun
On a horse with blazing guns
Mama don't come looking for me
Spinning out of control
This shaky heart is young
But it's learning how to love
Mama don't come looking for me
Spinning out of control
Spinning out of control

And I want you to know
That I'm a lion man
I'm a trying man
And I want you to know
That I'm a a lion man
I'm the hired band

People say I'm strange
So I'm trying to make a change
Mama don't come looking for me
Spinning out of control
I don't know what I am
But I'm doing the best I can
Mama don't come looking for me
Spinning out of control
Spinning out of control

And I want you to know
That I'm a lion man
I'm a trying man
And I want you to know
That I'm a a lion man
I'm the hired band
And I want you to know
That I'm a lion man
I'm a trying man
And I want you to know
That I'm a a lion man
I'm the hired band

Singing songs of hope
But I don't know where to go
Mama don't come looking for me
Spinning out of control
Troubled days are gone
But the nights are still long
Mama don't come looking for me
Spinning out of control
Spinning out of control

And I want you to know
That I'm a lion man
I'm a trying man
And I want you to know
That I'm a lion man
I'm the hired band
And I want you to know
I'm a lion man
I'm a tired man
And I want you to know
That I'm a lion man
I'm the hired band
