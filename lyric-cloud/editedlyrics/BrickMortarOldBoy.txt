What up what up, old boy?
It took awhile to find you, to track you down
By the river with them cold boys
I heard you made a million
It doesn't matter what I do or say
I never ever seem to get his attention
He lives a hundred-thousand miles away
I can't decide if he's a myth or a legend

I can't be the best
Still I hold on to
Won't be the best
Still I hold on to
I can't be the best
Still I hold on to
Won't be the best
Still I hold on to
Still I hold on to

What up what up, old boy?
It took awhile to find you, to track you down
By the river with them cold boys
I heard you made a million
Hi
I am your son
You are to blame
Goodbye

I can't be the best
Still I hold on to
Won't be the best
Still I hold on to
I can't be the best
Still I hold on to
Won't be the best
Still I hold on to
And still I hold on to
I can't be the best
Still I hold on to
Won't be the best
Still I hold on to
I can't be the best
Still I hold on to
Won't be the best
Still I hold on to
More
Something more 
Something...
