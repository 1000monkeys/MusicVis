Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on... on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on... on my mind
Tell... tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give... give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on...
You were always on...
You were always on my mind
You were always on... on my mind
