I am the killer
I am the assassin
My Lord made me call
He's got new mission for me
In the past I was
The astrodestroyer
I traveled for millions light years
The Universe is my home
I see the fall
I see the fall of human race
The stars are aligned
This means that the time has come
The Council of Cosmodemonic
Set that this is the time
I am not a disciple
Of the Left-Hand Path
Not a devil of black magick
I’m a dignitary of the universe
I see the fall
I see the fall of human race
