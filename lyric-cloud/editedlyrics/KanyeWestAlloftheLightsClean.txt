It's Lil $heep

It's my debut night and I'm droppin' 36
Like I'm Kobe Bryant playin' against the New York Knicks
Try to shoot me, I guarantee you'll miss
Call me Clinton Portis, yeah, cause I move the sticks
Finished my first song, man it was alright
But like fine wine, man this shit takes time
I see everything, I've got a sniper's eyesight
And I'm ready for this road, I'm gonna stay on my grind
This my first track, yeah I'm my own teacher
Cole should have won, double platinum, no features
I got citizenship from north of the border
Talk trash, I'll investigate like Law and Order
This my second batch of raps, the first was trash
Hopefully one day, I will make some mad cash
The games so sick, it'll give you a red rash
Better hop on the wagon, yeah, it's leavin' fast

This is what I want, yeah I'm a stay persistent
You gotta stop messin' round and bitchin'
This is the number one thing on my wish list
I'm gonna stay workin' till I get this
If you want it then why don't you go and get it
I'm not gonna stop, no matter what resistant
I hope god will eventually grant my wishes
Cause this the number one thing on my wishlist

There's a new shooter, put the schools on lockdown
Get off your high horse, man you need to hop down
I grew up this year, man I know a lot now
FDT, yeah lets have a walkout
I'll give you goosebumps, yeah I'm Travis Scott
Boom, Bam, Bop, call me Supa Hot
Ain't from the hood, I lived a white privileged life
When I rap, I feel higher then a kite
This is COD baby, I got you in my sights
So be careful what you say, it may be your last night
My raps so cold, you can put em in a refrigerator
Call me Tim Tebow yeah, I'm a Florida Gator
Now you show me fake love, yeah I'm Drake
Yeah I'm eatin', I gotta clean up my plate
Walter White, yeah I'm cookin' like a chemist
This my debut night, and your in attendance
Mess with me, catch an elbow like Ron Artest
Is screwin' with me something you really wanna test?
This right here ain't even my best
Just wait, your gonna love what's next

This is what I want, yeah I'm a stay persistent
You gotta stop messin' round and bitchin'
I'm gonna stay workin' till I get this
If you want it then why don't you go and get it
I'm not gonna stop, no matter what resistant
I hope god will eventually grant my wishes
Cause this the number one thing on my wishlist
I'm gonna keep workin' till I get this

Okay, let's have a toast
For the boys who never boast
And they just stay and coast
That's what I wanna be the most
Call me Mario cause I'll jump on your head
Better watch out cause here come the FEDs
Saturday morning and you still in bed
But I'm already up spittin' tracks instead
I'm not scared to give you an ounce of that lead
Cause you know I'm gonna aim, straight for that head
Hit you with that shot fake, now your out of bounds
I'm a stay workin' and hopefully grab the crown
I'm Flo Rida, spin your head right round
I'll sniff you out like I'm a blood hound
Andrew Wiggins, yeah my future's so bright
Kanye West, turn on all of the lights
Debut night, thanks for comin'
But you better hurry up, the clock is runnin'
