We've got forever
Slippin through our hands
We've got no more time
To never understand
Falling footsteps
Weighing heavy on me
Behind darkness
Beneath candles
Whispers waltz
Around our dreams
The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
Between two points
Between two points
Feet turning black
Is this the path we must walk
No turning back
Wish I could just hear you talk
Can something like this be pulled
From under our feet
Leaving our skin
And burning coals to meet
Tell me now
The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
Between two points
Between two points
The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
Between two points
Between two points
Understand
Between two points
Between two points
Between two points
Between two points
