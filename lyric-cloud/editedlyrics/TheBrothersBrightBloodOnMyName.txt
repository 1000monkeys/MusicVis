There's a reckonin' a-comin'
And it burns beyond the grave
Lead inside my belly
'cause my soul has lost its way
Oh, Lazarus
How did your debts get paid?
Oh, Lazarus
Were you so afraid?
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
With the Hounds of Hell comin' after you
I've got blood, I've got blood on my name
When the fires, when the fires are consumin' you
And your sacred stars won't be guiding you
I've got blood, I've got blood
Blood on my name
Not a spell gonna be broken
With a potion or a priest
When you're cursed you're always hopin'
That a prophet would be grieved
Oh, Lazarus
How did your debts get paid?
Oh, Lazarus
Were you so afraid?
Can't you see I'm sorry
I will make it worth your while
Made a dead man's money
You can see it in my smile
Oh, Lazarus
How did your debts get paid?
Oh, Lazarus
Were you so afraid?
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
And the whole wide world's comin' after you
I've got blood, I've got blood on my name
When the fires, when the fires are consuming you
And your sacred stars won't be guiding you
I've got blood, I've got blood
Blood on my name
It won't be long
'Til I'm dead and gone
It won't be long
'Til I'm dead and gone
Watch the fires rise under my skin
Down to the bone
Scorchin' my soul
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
With the Hounds of Hell comin' after you
I've got blood, I've got blood on my name
When the fires, when the fires are consuming you
And your sacred stars won't be guiding you
I've got blood, I've got blood on my name
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
And the whole wide world's comin' after you
I've got blood, I've got blood
Blood on my name
