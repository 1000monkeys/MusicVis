You love hearing me vent, this is no heat from the vent
When the rent due, you don't know what I've been through
When we can't afford lights
I write in the dark with a paper I'm putting my pen to
Try to fuck with my mental
Said my potential is minimum wage
Majority die before twenty five
Forty years later we're put in a grave
I'm filled up with rage
This is the culture you sent me to save?
Society stuck in a cage
Remembering back in the day
Feeling so real when I ride while I bump Kanye
But damn, huh
Real turned into photoshopped Kim K
Everyday when they wake up, girls cake up
On your make up all over their face
They think it's okay
They're fucking their way to the top
They see all your money and stare at their waist
They throw up their dinner not knowin' you're fake
They'll never compare to those pics that you take
And this is the world that you fuckin' create
A world that your daughter can't even escape
See, you were the one that was left to decay
A world in which I have been sent here to save, but 'Ye
I think were on the same page
Cause I've been jackin' off to Kim since I was in the fifth grade
You see you show us how to live, but it's a fib to get paid
Now Mr. West, I got a question, who are the new slaves?
See what media made, the point of the game
Is slaved up with TV and radio playing
I ain't pointing the blame, I ain't pointing the blame
Cause it all don't hang
On you
I'm a slave of the truth and
That's the point that I need you to prove, well
We're slaved to a label
And it's funny that labels are slaved to the youth
So why can't you see all the power in you?
Kid from your class couldn't pass but he drew
Till it turned into music you're listening to
Now weâ€˜re changing the world, motherfucking IQ
Walked in the label like, "Yo what it do
So give me a mil', better off make it two"
Creative control in a bowl full of stew
So you can ask Dan, he was there with me too
Ugh, I don't like this dude, I ain't signing shit
Ten writers who can barely write a hit
Compare me too, check the writer list
There are images who the industry will use
As a fucking tool just to get more rich
Do you get it yet? I'm sick of the lyin'
"Indie," when really you're signed
Making it hard for real indie art like mine
Money don't grow on a tree like pine
Lyin' to fans, robbing them blind
Keeping them buying by keeping them blind
Airing you out it's a matter of time
Stuck in a bind, you can't buy...
Time, can't buy time
Open your legs and never the mind
You're looking for head and never inside
We're looking to find the attention online
We only see surface we're lame and we're dry
Placing our value in things that we buy
We're staring at ass but never in eyes
We're so disconnected from bein' alive
From bein' alive
So disconnected from bein' alive
Take a look in my eyes
Then in my soul and see what you find
Yeah, I used to get bullied so bad I would sit in my room and I'd cry
Now the same motherfucker like, "Mark, where is the song I could buy?"
Now open your eyes
Human, but more like a virus, greedy and spineless
Take from the earth and we fill it with violence
Take and we take we're the same as a tyrant
Never been silent
Learn what we know from a Facebook post
It's a joke now we're looking so mindless
Stupid we seem to define it
On the same boat, when they think we would sink then we fight it
Love is the only thing timeless
Live in an era where we value weed over love
So you can buy a drug, but you can't buy love
So you can buy a bottle, but you can't buy grub
So you can buy class doesn't mean you're not dumb
Most the people I know, they would rather feel numb
And so tell me when was the last time you had fun
Other then when you fuck or turn up at the club
Man, I'm sick of this wack shit
You're faker than Iggy Azalea's accent
You've to live in the past tense
Me, I'm the future in everything I put to action
What's a rap god to a rappin' assassin?
No one is matchin' my passion
Power through tinder you're looking for action
Now at the club and you're pounding the captain
Never found passion, living in fraction
Lonely and asking what your life could be
Now when life gets hard you don't fight but instead you gon' light the weed
So you spend four years and you work real hard to go get a degree
Now you're working a five nine to five and you're chasing another man's dream
Most of us settle it seems
Girl, you're worth more than you fucking a town full of guys
Nothing more precious than time
Nothing more tragic then dying while bein' alive
We look at the sky
Know that one day we'll decay in the dirt we let die
I'm here to deliver you all from the lies
And know that I gave you a piece of my... mind
