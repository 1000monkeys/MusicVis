Can you please tell me your story?
Tell it to me one more time
I just want you to keep talking so I can make up my mind
So far you like my voice and I like your point of view
Come play with me in these sound waves
I think there is room for two

And all this time you've been searching for something
Turn around in circles, hold nothing
I know the damage that love can do, I am here for you
And all this time I've been waiting for someone
To show me the meaning of a real love
I've been looking for someone like me
For what seems an eternity

I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need

Now you can shed your armor
Now I am on your side
Your eyes don't have to wander
I see a future bathed in life
This feels like something solid
His feels like I can hold my breath
This feels like I've got something
When I thought I had nothing left

And all this time you've been searching for something
Turn around in circles, hold nothing
I know the damage that love can do, I am here for you
And all this time I've been waiting for someone
To show me the meaning of a real love
I've been looking for someone like me
For what seems an eternity
Oh, I can, I can be

I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need
I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need, oh
I can be, I can be anything you want and need

I can be anything
I can be anything, anything
Anything, anything
Anything, anything you need
Anything you want and need
