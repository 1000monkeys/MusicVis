[Intro: Klayton, 
Fluffy Starr
]
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open 
(mmm)
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall 
(mmm)
A fading memory (when my mind is frozen)
(Right!)
(Let's go)
(Let's go)

I can see a frozen point in time where her figure still awaits
Tongue of fire tracing lips outline where frozen breath originates (right!)
With one motion of her wanting eyes she strips everything away
This one moment is intensified and the colors all fade to grey

(Ooh-ooh) I am in the only place that I want to be
(Ooh-ooh) Though we know that it ends eventually
(Ooh-ooh) But it's alright 'cause right now we're frozen
(I want to forget mistakes they've helped me make)
("It's better to be broken than to break")
(Right!)
[Chorus: Klayton, 
Fluffy Starr
]
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
(Mmm, let's go)
(Mmm, let's go)

I can see a frozen point in time that is easy to retrace
Light and darkness are both intertwined, the elements are in their place
(Ooh-ooh) With one motion of her wanting mind the real world begins to fade
And all the hateful things I have become temporarily go away (right!)

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
Frozen
(Right!)

When my mind's frozen
Take me anywhere you want to go
We're far from anything that feels like home, 
let's go
Here I'm anyone I want to be
It's here and now, and now it's only you and me
It's never enough, 
mmm, that's true
I want to stay here, 
yeah, and I do, too
Breakin' it down, 
takin' it down
With 
smell, touch and taste, sight and sound

How long will I be here without you near?
Because I'm so cold
"Break them first or I'll get broken" is not what I was told
Now I'm so cold, I'm so cold
So cold

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Frozen (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Frozen (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) (I'm so cold)
Frozen (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
