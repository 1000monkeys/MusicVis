So there you are
Surrounded by thousands of people
Alone, but definitely not by yourself

Aking yourself what the f just happened
Well, Hardstyle just happened !
And it left its undeniable mark on you !
And you... you are not alone
We've all been through it
You're with allies, friends
This, this is Family
All connected by that thrill you just felt
Cemented in tremoring kicks
And an unyielding bass
We're at the verge of a new age
And it's time for you to give in
So you'll finally be able to let go
