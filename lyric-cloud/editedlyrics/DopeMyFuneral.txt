Now as I lay here in the dark
And I think back to the start
I know some things have to end
For the next one to begin

I walk alone, free at last
I feel the pressure letting go
From the very bottom of my soul
Flesh and bone for the past
Like the ashes in the rain
And fade away

It's my funeral
Welcome you all
This is the end of the line
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't want to leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own

Now as we stand two worlds apart
The time's hardened up my heart
From a world of no regrets
That I hope won't soon forget

I walk the line on broken glass
I let the passion take control
Of the very bottom of my soul
Cross the line, fade to black
Hold the candle to the flame
And light the way

To my funeral
Welcome you all
This is the end of the line
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't want to leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own

It's my funeral
Welcome you all
This is the end of the line
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't want to leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own

This is the end of the line
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't want to leave you behind
(Don't want to leave you behind)
But this is the end of the line (goodbye)
It's my funeral
It's my funeral
