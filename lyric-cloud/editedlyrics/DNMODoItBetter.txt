Drips on your legs
On your shoulders
When you follow the curve of my body
I forget to breathe
When you move me just like that
Breathe into me just like that
If you knew me you'd know that
I can keep going
Yeah I can keep going

You ain't never met someone like me before
And you ain't never somebody do what I can do
Do, do, do
I can do it better


Everybody wants you
Everybody loves you
I don't wanna get inside the mind of someone
So cruel-hearted like you
I just want your touch, no
Not your useless crush
Don't needa worry about the
Mixed hints
Fingerprints
Tell me 'bout your bullshit
Everybody's waiting on the
Bachelorette to petal pick
Take my body for a ride, oh
Tell me while you stroke my pride

I don't want your vague suspense
I'm waiting for my consequences
All your colors taste expensive
Black and blue but gold accented
Don't know where you go at night
But
Wish you'd just get off my mind, like
I don't need to know who you flirt
Just Know I Can Do You Better
