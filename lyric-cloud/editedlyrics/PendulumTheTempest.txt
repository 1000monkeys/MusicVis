Saw you the other day
Looking so undermined
Acting like it wouldn't happen
Making sense of anything that you could find
Because it's just about to happen
And you'll be there
You must have known the storm was coming
When the clouds appeared
May as well let the rain come down
And join the circus of people
While you're there
Something is changing
Bruising and aching
And I'm trying to find out what it is
When I fix her, she's breaking
Reason keeps escaping me
Protecting and burning like a cyst
I know that I can help you
I just don't fucking want to
And the feeling gets stronger by the day
You say that I'm selfish
But I don't really need this
And I'm just so sick of the chase
While you are letting your guard down
I will be letting myself go
While you keep running your ship aground
I will be setting myself alight
It's too late, you've dropped the drawbridge
You let the vampires in
You caused this shit to happen and, now, you want out
It's too late, you've dropped the drawbridge
You let the vampires in
I hope you know now that it's nobody's fault but yours
While you are letting your guard down
I will be letting myself go
While you keep running your ship aground
I will be setting myself alight
