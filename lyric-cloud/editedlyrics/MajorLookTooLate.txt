How do I breakthrough and make life better?
Situation's changing just like the weather
Too much sorrow and not enough laughter
Beg that to change here to thereafter
How do I progress in this mind state I live in?
Everybody takes but nobody's givin'
Those closest seem to break your heart
Throw away the keys and you're always apart
How do I proceed like nothing's changed?
Everybody's asking me are you OK
Struggling every second, minute out these days
Once had it up but threw it all away
You don't want me you don't need me no more 
Now it's too late to cry
You don't want me you don't need me no more
Now it's too late to cry
You don't want me you don't need me no more
Now it's too late
