I love the breaching brittle liar - liar
The sweet imposter, the cautious killer
Take off the ring I’ll get you higher - higher
I’m gonna wait for the tide
‘cause I’m a builder, she’s a buyer - buyer
I see schematics, a rotting footing
Sniff out the gas, pull out the lighter - lighter
I see the spark in her eyes
Oh I’ll wait, for you to start to fall apart
Oh I’ll wait, for you to start to fall apart
‘Cause I’m addicted to the trouble - trouble
The Mona Lisa, the silent anger
She’s been living in the bubble - bubble
Yeah that goes double for me
I’ll be dancing by the fire - fire
I’ll be dancing while she burns her house down
Just let the pressure make the diamonds - diamonds
Don’t throw me back in the sea
Oh I’ll wait, for you to start to fall apart
Oh I’ll wait, for you to start to fall apart
I’ll be dancing by the fire - fire
I’ll be dancing while you burn the house down
Just let the pressure make the diamonds - diamonds
I’m at the coward’s way out
Oh I’ll wait, for you to start to fall apart
Oh I’ll wait, for you to start to fall apart
