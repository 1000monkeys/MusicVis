God won’t take me to heaven
Blood on my knees when I’m begging
Why? I didn’t mean to start a war
Wanna be strong but I’m broken
Try to breathe but I’m choking
I’m in a million pieces on the floor

I’m making friends with my demons
They understand what I’m needing
I just wanna feel something
I wish I was dreaming
I’m making friends with my demons
I try to run but I need them
I just wanna feel something
I wish I was dreaming

I got used to the taste of
Poison on my tongue, what a waste of
Time. Give me a pill for paradise

I’m making friends with my demons
They understand what I’m needing
I just wanna feel something
I wish I was dreaming
I’m not afraid of the darkness
It’s all around me regardless
I’m tired of feeling nothing
Why am I so heartless?

Tell these white lies, see how I hide
Sticks and stones they broke all my bones
Tell these white lies, see how I hide (so many secrets)
Sticks and stones they broke all my bones
