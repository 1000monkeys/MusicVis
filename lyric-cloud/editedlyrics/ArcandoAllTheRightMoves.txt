Verse:
Let's paint a picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told ya
I'll be the King of Hearts, you be the Queen of Spades
And we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we've got it good
But they've got it made
And the grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up
But soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name
They've got
Pre-Chorus:
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they've got
All the right moves in all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down, I said
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
I said, everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
(They've got)
Drop:
So yeah, we're going down They've got
So yeah, we're going down, I said
So yeah, we're going down They've got
So yeah, we're going down, I said
Verse:
Do you think I'm special, do you think I'm nice
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces
Between the noise you hear and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces
It can't be possible that the rain can fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over the world it's said, they've got, they've got
Pre-Chorus:
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they've got
All the right moves in all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down, I said
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
I said, everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
(They've got)
Drop:
So yeah, we're going down They've got
So yeah, we're going down, I said
So yeah, we're going down They've got
So yeah, we're going down, I said
Outro:
It don't matter what you see
I know I could never be someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say
I know I could never face someone that could sound like you
(All the right moves, yeah)
