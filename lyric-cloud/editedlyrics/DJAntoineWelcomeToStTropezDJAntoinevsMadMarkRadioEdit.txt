Welcome to St. Tropez (oh yeah)
Timati
Get fresh, gotta stay fly
Get the jet I gotta stay high
High up like a la la la
Ain't nothin here that my money can't buy
Dolce, Gucci and Louis V
Yacht so big I could live on the sea
You for real you can't see me
In these Euro frames the whole world change
Mad bitches so much brought
Feel the life when I wanna fuck them all
Get mad brain in my very fast car
Ferrari V12 Maranello on my arm
Ladies can't resist the charm
Haters, kiss the ring of the Don
And we do this all day, welcome to St. Tropez
Kalenna
Woah, what a night
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we're in St. Tropez
Woah, what a night
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we're in St. Tropez
Timati
Welcome to St. Tropez (oh yeah)
Timati
We make money, money we spending'
Get mad Henny, swimming and women
Imported linen, Egyptian cotton
The party just started, the party ain't stopin'
Keep shit poppin', poppin these bottles
Haters keep hatin', fuckin' these models
So much money like we own the lotto
Pull up to a club in a white Murci√©lago
He don't make dollars, he don't make cents
He don't make you rich, he don't mean shit. Shit?
We the shit. I mean how much better can it get?
Harleys, Maseratis, Gallardos, we make too much do'
And we spend it all day, welcome to St. Tropez (oh yeah)

Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, all the way from Moscow, Russia
Give a warm welcome for heavy weight rap champion B Smooth the Groove
So make some noise for the one and only, Mr. Black Star
Timati & Blue Marine
Get it up, don't stop your body
C'mon ladies, let's get naughty
Get it up, now everybody
C'mon girls, hey come to daddy
Get it up, don't stop your body
Get it up, again your body
Get it up, now everybody
Get it up for music
