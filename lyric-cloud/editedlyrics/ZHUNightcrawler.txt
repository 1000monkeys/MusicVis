Blink once, blink twice
Blink, don't forget
Blink once, blink twice
Blink, don't forget
Blink once, blink twice
Blink, don't forget
Blink once, blink twice
Blink, don't forget

Nightcrawler, I am the enemy
Nightcrawler, why are you following?
Nightcrawler, is it almost my time to go?
Nightcrawler, I have a devil in me
Nightcrawler, is this the death of me?
Nightcrawler, is it almost my time?

This is a phenomenon
We don't know who he is
We don't know where he's hiding
But there's one thing, we see a shadow
We know where he sleeps
And we know where his footsteps have been
We need all our intelligence to be focused on him
Our number one goal, is to capture this man
Dead, or alive

Don't blink, don't blink
Don't blink, don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink, don't forget 
(Don't blink, don't blink, don't blink)
Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink, don't forget 
(Don't blink, don't blink, don't blink)

Nightcrawler, I am the enemy
Nightcrawler, why are you following?
Nightcrawler, is it almost my time to go?
Nightcrawler, I have a devil in me
Nightcrawler, is this the death of me?
Nightcrawler, is it almost my time?
