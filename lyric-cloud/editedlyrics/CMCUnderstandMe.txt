Every day when the night falls and it's you and me
Feelin' like you're made of stone and I ain't got an iron key
Can we vibe with the lights off? Tell me what do you see
Feelin' like you’re made of stone

Baby, if you could understand me
I wouldn't feel so empty
I don't wanna let you go, ever let you go
Say you understand me
I'll give you my everything
If you need to let me go, ever let me go

I won't let you go-o
I won't let you go-o
I won't let you go-o
I won't let you go-o

I can't decide if you're the right one in your eyes I see
We're riding on a tide that turns, how funny is the irony?
Like you're alive with a mic on, tell me do you ride for me
Breakin' down your walls

Baby, if you could understand me
I wouldn't feel so empty
I don't wanna let you go, ever let you go
Say you understand me
I'll give you my everything
If you need to let me go, ever let me go

I won't let you go-o
I won't let you go-o

I cannot lie to you
I keep on trying to meet you where you are
I don't know what to do
Can't say good bye to you, oh
I cannot lie to you
I keep on trying to meet you where you are
I still make time for you 'cause I can't say good bye to you

Baby, if you could understand me
I wouldn't feel so empty
I don't wanna let you go, ever let you go
Say you understand me
I'll give you my everything
If you need to let me go, ever let me go

I won't let you go-o (Oh yeah yeah, ooh-ooh)
No, I won't let you go
I won't let you go-o
No I'm not letting you go
I won't let you go-o
I’m not letting go

'Cause I won't let you go
