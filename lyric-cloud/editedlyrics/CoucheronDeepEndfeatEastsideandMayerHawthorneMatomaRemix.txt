Clarity, the spirits all around me
Heavenly, the way your love surrounds me
Is it me?
Feels like a beginning
Everybody's everything and time and space don't mean a thing
Easy come, easy go
(Easy go, easy come)
Easy go, easy come
(Easy go, easy come)

All my friends
Here with me, swimming in the deep end
On the weekend
All my friends
Here with me, swimming in the deep
Endlessly floating on

Up and down, the rhythm's hypnotizing
Hold me now, we'll never feel this free again
All around, the steam is slowly rising
Everything is everyone and nothing's new under the sun
Easy come, easy go
Easy go, easy come
(easy go, easy come)

All my friends
Here with me, swimming in the deep end
On the weekend
All my friends
Here with me, swimming in the deep
Endlessly floating on
