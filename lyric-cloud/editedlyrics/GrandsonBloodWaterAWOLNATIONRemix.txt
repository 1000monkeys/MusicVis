Look me in my eyes
Tell me everything's not fine
Oh, the people ain't happy
When the river has run dry
You thought you could go free
But the system is done for
If you listen real closely
There's a knock at your front door

Never get free
Lamb to the slaughter
What'chu gon' do
When there's blood in the water
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What'chu gon' do
When there's blood in the water

I am the storm!
(Ooh,) I am the storm!
Never get free
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water?
Never get free
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water?
Beg me for mercy
Admit you were toxic
You poisoned me just for
Another dollar in your pocket
Now I am the violence
I am the sickness
Won't accept your silence
Beg me for forgiveness

Never get free
Lamb to the slaughter
What'chu gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What'chu gon' do
When there's blood in the water?

I am the storm! (storm)
I am the storm! (storm)
Never get free (free, free)
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water?
Never get free (free, free)
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water? (water, water, water)

I am the people
I am the storm
I am the riot
I am the swarm
When the last trees fall
And the animal can't hide
Money won't solve it
What's your alibi?
What's your alibi?
What's your alibi?

What'chu gon' do when there's
Blood in the
Blood in the water?
When there's blood in the
Blood in the water?

Never get free (free, free)
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water?
Never get free (free, free, free)
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water? (water, water, water)
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water? (water, water, water)
What'chu gonna do
When there's blood in the water? (water, water, water)
