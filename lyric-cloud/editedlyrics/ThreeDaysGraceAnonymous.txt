In my mind worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keeping going on
In my mind oceans divide
I don’t know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
(Hello, hello, hello)

In my mind worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keeping going on
In my mind oceans divide
I don’t know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
Anonymous

Hey
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
Hey, is there anybody out there
Oh
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
Hey
I get by in a world with no conscience
I try and I try but I am anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
Just like me

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
(Just like me)
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
(Hello, hello, hello)

We feel so anonymous
(Hello, hello, hello
We feel so anonymous
(Hello, hello, hello)
