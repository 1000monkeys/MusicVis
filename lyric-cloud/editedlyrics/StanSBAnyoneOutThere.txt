She's gone, but not for long
She made her choices, and they were wrong
So struggle all you want
'Cause they won't hear you, they don't care

Its easy, but don't you try
It's a pointless way to die
I don't see you when I open my eyes
I need to be near you, Is anyone out there?

Is anyone out there?
Is anyone out there?
Is anyone out there?

She's leaving, but she don't know why
Finds a bottle to ease her mind
She starts screaming as she starts to cry
She knows she's alone now, is anyone out there?

Is anyone out there?
Is anyone out there?

She remembers the man she lost
She will find him, whatever the cost
She knows that the road is long
But she needs him, she don't care

Reunited, wrong time, wrong place
A tombstone in the rain
No kisses, no embrace
Forced to her knees, loses faith

Its easy, but don't you try
It's a pointless way to die
I don't see you when I open my eyes
I need to be near you, Is anyone out there?

Is anyone out there?
Is anyone out there?
Is anyone out there?
