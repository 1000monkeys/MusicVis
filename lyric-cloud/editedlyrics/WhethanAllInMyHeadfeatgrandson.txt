Aw shit

Have, have you ever thought
That you don't know at all?
Feeling better off dead
Aw shit
'Cause I wish you woulda called
'Cause I found out these voices
Are all in my-
All in my head

All in my-
All in my-
(Jump)
I'm stuck with these voices
They're all in my head
All in my-
All in my-
(Jump)
All in my-
I'm stuck with these voices
They're all in my head

Somebody call the doctor
I think I'm seeing double
On my shoulder is a monster
Think that I'm in trouble
Nobody got medicine
No one got a cure
So I'll keep on running
'Til I know what for
Or should I take a drag?
I wish that I could stop
Keep bailing on my friends
'Cause I can't get out of bed
My demons shut it down
And they opened up shop
Now I'm stuck with these voices
They're all in my, all in my head

All in my-
All in my-
(Jump)
All in my-
I'm stuck with these voices
They're all in my head
All in my-
All in my-
(Jump)
All in my-
I'm stuck with these voices
They're all in my head

(Yo!)
There ain't no arrival
No destination
Nothing's gonna free me from my imagination
There ain't no finish line
No door to open
That's gonna berate me from my sense of broken
Aw shit

Have, have you ever thought
That you don't know at all?
Feeling better off dead
Aw shit
'Cause I wish you woulda called
'Cause I found out these voices
Are all in my-
All in my head

All in my-
I'm stuck with these voices
They're all in my head
