Don't know when it started and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I'm gonna get the bends
And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity

(If you wanna be)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
(And if you wanna see)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
(If you wanna be)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
(And if you wanna see)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity Ink

Hey, I really wanna tell you about my life
Everyday I like to pump and get hyped
Everyone I know they love to get down
Everybody turn it up, and then we'll turn the world around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round

Oh, you know we are the Infinity
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
Oh, you know we are the Infinity (Infinity, woho)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity (Infinity)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity Ink
Oh
Oh, oh

Everybody calls me Mr. Infinity
Rocking down in your vicinity
I don't care, I don't mind
I like to leave my fears behind
I love to take you to this cosmic flow
Everybody better gotta get this, go
Come on, let's feel this flow
Here we go, here we go
Moving it up, shaking it up, bringing it down
Infinity Ink, we got that sound
Moving it up, shaking it up, bringing it down
Infinity Ink, we got that sound
Moving it up, shaking it up, bringing it down
Infinity Ink, we got that sound
Moving it up, shaking it up, bringing it down
Infinity Ink, we got that sound

Don't know when it started, and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I'm gonna get the bends
And I'm stretching out forever into the galaxy
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity

(If you wanna be)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
(And if you wanna see)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
(If you wanna be)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
(And if you wanna see)
Oh, you know we are the Infinity Ink

Hahaha
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
Oh, you know we are the Infinity
Oh, you know we are the Infinity Ink
