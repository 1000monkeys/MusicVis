Give me a second
I'm trying to select the appropriate weapon (uh)
Watch where you stepping
Them snakes all around you know they connected (uh)
When I was a kid my grand-mamma told me I can't go to heaven
So I stopped praying and asking for blessings
And started preparing for my Armageddon
Got nothing to lose, I'm all in
Walking the edge, don't fall in
Enough of the lies don't apologies
I don't understand are you foreign?
This is the place this is the site
Grab all your people and log in
I'm waiting I don't care how long this is gonna take
Watching and waiting for that first mistake

Don't come up missing
Don't get it twisted
I'm not Rihanna but boy you a goner you right on my hit list
I'm keeping my distance
Just checking the listings
I'm always aware for your current position
I just hold out till the perfect conditions

Coming Alive
Heat of the night
Now is the time
Don't try to hide
Cause I'm gonna hunt you like an animal

I know you thought it was over
I know you thought it was finished
I know you think I'm a cynic
But you know this shit only business
People act different as soon you winning
Man I know this shit ain't no different
You pull up in cars, you act like it's yours
But we know that shit is just rented
Benefit of the doubt
We the ones that your mummy warned you about
Should have stayed in the house
Don't open your mouth
We lurk in the swamps like we in the south
So count your days
Hold up let me count the ways you gon' pay
When I spot you I'm coming straight through
To your face no foreplay

Don't come up missing
Don't get it twisted
I'm not Rihanna but boy you a goner you right on my hit list
I'm keeping my distance
Just checking the listings
I'm always aware for your current position
I just hold out till the perfect conditions

Coming Alive
Heat of the night
Now is the time
Don't try to hide
Cause I'm gonna hunt you like an animal
Coming Alive
Heat of the night
Now is the time
Don't try to hide
Cause I'm gonna hunt you like an animal
