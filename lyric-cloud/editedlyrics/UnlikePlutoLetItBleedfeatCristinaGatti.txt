He fills my fantasies
Visions of ecstasy
No coming back to me
Keeps me on the short leash

And my guts and my bones achin' I know
Together we fall apart
And nothing can live, nothing can thrive
When you keep me in the dark
And you act so damn cold
Boy don't you know
That you're the one with all the control
You've cut me now prepare
To watch me bleed

Let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Pour salt into the wounds
That you've caused me

There's only misery
To keep me company
Love me or let me be
Please stop haunting me

And my guts and my bones achin' I know
Together we fall apart
And nothing can live, nothing can thrive
When you keep me in the dark
And you act so damn cold
Boy don't you know
That you're the one with all the control
You've cut me now prepare
To watch me bleed

Let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Pour salt into the wounds
That you've caused me

And my guts and my bones
And they achin' I know
And together we fall, we fall apart
And you act so damn cold
Boy don't you know
That you're the one with all the control
You've cut me now prepare
To watch me bleed

Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Just let it bleed, bleed
Let it bleed
Pour salt into the wounds
That you've caused me
