Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Whenever the dark comes out, I feel dizzy
Blurry eye with the perfect vision
I hear the bells are ringing
Calling me out cause they need someone who's ready

I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall
I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall

I've drawn back on love too fake
Can't hide in the light of the day
I know I hear the beep from you calling in
How about you and me go and make some mistakes?

Tomorrow's on the horizon
When you caught my eyes
And now time's flying
Good moonlight top the sky
And we are just aside, the dawn is night

I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall
I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall

Good streets are empty in the briskets
How could nobody else can see this?
Oh, oh the way I feel it
Only for you the way I'm feeling

You're going another night
Staying another time
Can't even see the light
You're going another line
Staying another time
Can't even see the light
I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall
I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall

You're going another night
Staying another time
Can't even see the light
You're going another line
Staying another time
Can't even see the light
I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall
I hear the Nightcall, I hear the Nightcall
