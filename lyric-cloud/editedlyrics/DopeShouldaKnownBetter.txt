She said (whoo)
I shoulda known better (I shoulda know better)
I'll never love you again (whoo)
I shoulda known better (I shoulda know better)
I'll never trust you again (whoo)
It's a sticky situation and it's full of complication again
I shoulda (whoo)
I shoulda known better
Forever and ever

I'll never love you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again

I said (whoo)
You shoulda known better (You shoulda known better)
I'll never touch you again (whoo)
You shoulda known better (You shoulda known better)
I'll never fuck you again (whoo)
It's a sticky situation and it's full of complication again
You shoulda (whoo)
You shoulda known better
Forever and ever

I'll never love you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never love you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again

Cause I believed we would last forever
I still believed when I said so long, and I was so wrong
And I believed we would stay together, together
Now I can see that nothing lasts forever

(Whoo)
I shoulda known better (I shoulda know better)
I'll never love you again (whoo)
You shoulda known better (You shoulda know better)
I'll never trust you again (whoo)
It's a sticky situation and it's full of complication again
We shoulda (whoo)
We shoulda known better
Forever and ever

I'll never love you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
I'll never love you again, I'll never love you again
I'll never trust you again
