I’ve already told ya
Can’t go on like this
Red lips, a kiss, and you got me calling for ya
Guess I hardly know you
You’re off limits
A classic twist—I think I’m falling for you
I think I’m falling for you
I’ve already told ya
Can’t just wish away
Those days, you say were such a problem for ya
And every word I told ya
Lost in cliché
One fragile phrase has got me
Godsend, moving like an angel
Pretend, suspend, read me like a fable
I know, bad blood bleeding
But I’d lie, if I tried, to play like I ain’t falling
Godsend, moving like an angel
Pretend, read me like a fable
I know, bad blood bleeding
But I’d lie, if I tried, to play like I ain’t falling
(To play like I ain't falling)

I think I’m falling for you
