My Capricorn
Knows when the love is gone
'Cause she reads those horoscopes
But she does it every morning
And I wait to see
If we got any hope
And if the stars align
She doesn't seem to mind
Me bein' around at all
And I hope the karma's right
But I guess it just relies
On the day that I was born

La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
No matter where I go
I'm never in control
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I'll make the stars align for Capricorn

Well, I should get a job
Down at the magazine
And I'll change astrology
And she won't know it's me
My anonymity
Is all I'm gonna need
I'll change a paragraph
To something better than
What's already written down
And then my Capricorn
Won't know what's going on
She'll love me even more

La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
No matter where I go
I'm never in control
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I'll make the stars align for Capricorn
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
No matter where I go
I'm never in control
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I'll make the stars align for Capricorn

I've got to have just a little bit
You come around when you calm down
I got the blood-red lipstick
La-la, la-la-la-la-la
I've got to have just a little bit
You come around when you calm down
I got the blood-red lipstick

La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
No matter where I go
I'm never in control
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I'll make the stars align for Capricorn
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Just like a Capricon
She won't know when the love is gone
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Just like a Capricon

Ay
