Can you hear the wind that's howling
Through the concrete trees
Got you praying on your knees
In the face of danger we're all brave
'Til the gun goes bang, bang, bang
It's a cruel, cruel world
No mercy left, yeah it's a cruel, cruel world
It'll break your heart and burn you down, down, down
Don't ever doubt that it's a cruel, cruel world
Oh it's a cruel, cruel world
Smoke will turn your soul to black
If you let it in
So close the door, confess your sins
Oh, when I was younger, it was on roses
Now they're dead and gone away
It's a cruel, cruel world
No mercy left, yeah it's a cruel, cruel world
It'll break your heart and burn you down, down, down
Don't ever doubt that it's a cruel, cruel world
Oh it's a cruel, cruel world
Oh, can you help me?
Oh, can you help me out?
Don't know who I can trust right now
Oh, can you help me?
Oh, can you help me out?
Oh
It's a cruel, cruel world
It's a cruel, cruel world
No mercy left, yeah it's a cruel, cruel world
It'll break your heart and burn you down, down, down
Don't ever doubt that it's a cruel, cruel world
Oh it's a cruel, cruel world 
(It'll burn you down)
