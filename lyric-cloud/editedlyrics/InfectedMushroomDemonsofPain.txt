Just when I thought that I knew when I'm moody of
Your faith, and the strength, and the love that you have brought upon
Me and you against the other one
Together I've defeated for the first time that I'm vivid
So I don't know why I'm dreaming of

Demons of pain
Looping all betrayals I've done in shame
Again and again
I thought that I'd been saved yet here I am
Those demons of pain
Looping my mistakes I've done in vain
Again and again
I thought that I'd been saved yet here I am

Just when I thought there's no door to escape my downs
You took all my pain and my shame and you pulled me up
Towards my dreams against the other ones
Together I've defeated for the first time that I'm vivid
So I don't know why I'm dreaming of

Demons of pain
Looping all betrayals I've done in shame
Again and again
I thought that I'd been saved yet here I am
Those demons of pain
Looping my mistakes I've done in vain
Again and again
I thought that I'd been saved yet here I am
