We get along just fine, here
On our own
What you want for it?
Another money mind, oh
You want to rob me blind
Not alone this time, oh

Don't wanna trust a liar
Don't wanna feed the fire
Tell me what to do, yeah
Listening to my heart
Is leading me from the dark
Tell me what to choose
Don't wanna trust a liar
Don't wanna feed the fire
Tell me what to do
Listening to my heart
Is leading me from the dark
Tell me what to choose
Tell me what to do

I hear those voices
Trying to keep us down
We ain't backing out
Because the time is now
Screaming till you're breathless
Till all the voices drown
We ain't backing down
Oh, our time is now

Don't wanna trust a liar
Don't wanna feed the fire
Tell me what to do
Listening to my heart
Is leading me from the dark
Tell me what to do (x2)
Don't want to trust a liar
They want to feed the fire
Tell me what to do (x3)
