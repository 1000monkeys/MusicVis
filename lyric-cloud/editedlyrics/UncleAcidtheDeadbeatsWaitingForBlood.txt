There's a man who's just been waiting here
All night long
As he watches you he's smiling there all
Alone
He needs something better but he knows
You're on your own
All the streetcreeps and their pushers here
Have all gone
Slowly swept below the streets where they
Belong
But there's something not right, its the violence
We love
There's a man in the darkness waiting for
Blood
Watch the broken television come to life
As the story cuts right through you like a
Knife
Under cold neon light, its the violence we love
And from the gutter he crawls, waiting for
Blood
