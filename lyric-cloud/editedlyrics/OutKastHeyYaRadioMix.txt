Small town big dreams, had a premonition
Hey XV

I was just a baby boy crazy in love with one lifestyle
Already had everything I need except the key in the ignition was to mild
Close to where that white guy lost himself I could count up to 8 mile
Yo, I started elementary when I was searching for the love
Called out a lot in class even though I pasted
Saying HEY YA! like my favorite OutKast
When the clocks hit 1:10 outside in recess
I taught the popular kids off brass monkey
Next day on the play set
They all were singing Beastie Boys then reset
I liked my teachers but my grades were like take this and erase this
Dumb negro image, inside of your head
Also with taking classes on my “s”s
The whole class a witness, I wasn't like the rest of those white boys
I cried for a day when my first and only drum set broke, I was annoyed
Snow days in class I recited lyrics of R&B/Soul songs
Cause mom always waited for me with her 2 infamous CD’s
Beyoncé & MJB. Or mix it up with the radio station 92.3
When I get off that yellow bus
I’d hear Ray, the Temps, Michael, Janet, & Stevie
My friends couldn't believe Pop & Rock weren't the only two types
When it comes to people rhythmically singing on the mic
Go home, drop my backpack, lunch box, and Reebok’s all next to the garage door
Darted to the study, got the computer running, and started up Napster
This program strengthened my relationship with this art
Also learned more history prior to what I knew already
Then Johnny Vacante started singing Baby Got Back
On the bus ride home, I asked whats that
But I figured he was talking about butts
But who raps that. He didn't know

Neva cheated, beaten , but she created me
Cause I actually listened
And no 2¢’s back
Jazz, Reggae, Hip-Hop, Blues, & R&B
Came to my senses
And I played those tracks
My first love through those speakers she spoke to me
Eased my naïve tension
And made me feel good to be black
Neva cheated, beaten, but she created me
Cause I actually listened
And no 2¢’s back

I got pretty jelly, hardly watching any telly. Begging my mom for a celly
So I could call that toll free number on that big screen and order my big dream
So yes I’m a certified misfit
Made my conversion over genres of masterpieces at such a young age
Parents were amazed Twas’ getting late tucked me in beautiful nightmares
I turn on my MP3
Turned volume low and I drift away
I picture the light off my device
Was a little too bright
That it was seen out of my bed
But so memorized Instead
I asked her 21 questions and we were wed
And we were wed


So ever since that innocent age of six
Independently picked clean or explicit
What lyrics I would lay and listen on those bass kicks
Are love only got stronger so we never quit
Different with some acoustics and bonus tracks tricks
But it all made sense to me logistics
