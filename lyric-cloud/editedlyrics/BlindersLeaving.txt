I can't let you do this
I don't know if I'm ever gonna be the same
Oh boy this gotta be more to this
Just me tell that, I'll hold you in my arms again

I know you're telling me you're leaving
But all I wanna do is hold you now
And hear the sound of your heart beating
If there's a way to stop this, show me how

Show me how
Show me how
Show me how
Show me how
Show me how

If there's a way to stop this, show me how
If there's a way to stop this, show me how

I can't let you do this
I don't know if I'm ever gonna be the same
Oh boy this gotta be more to this
Just me tell that, I'll hold you in my arms again

I know you're telling me you're leaving
But all I wanna do is hold you now
And hear the sound of your heart beating
If there's a way to stop this, show me how

Show me how
Show me how
Show me how
Show me how
Show me how

If there's a way to stop this, show me how
If there's a way to stop this, show me how
