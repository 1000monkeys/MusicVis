The sun city creeps
Did you say
Oh, let it go
We fall into love
Every day and take as we go

You can turn into town
You can turn day to day
But please don't take it away
Fall in to places
Falling apart
I'm falling today
The sun city eats
Let them waste
Oh, let it go
Ascend to the sky
Every day and come to the now

You can turn into town
You can turn day to day
But please don't take it away
Fall in to places
Falling apart
I'm falling today
The sun city creeps
Oh, let it go
We fall into love
And take as we go
The sun city creeps
Oh, let it go
We fall into love
And take as we go
The sun city creeps
Oh, let it go
We fall into love
And take as we go
The sun city creeps
Oh, let it go
We fall into love
And take as we go
