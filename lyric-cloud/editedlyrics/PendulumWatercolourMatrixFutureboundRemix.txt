When I'm falling down
Will you pick me up again?
When I'm too far gone
Dead in the eyes of my friends
Will you take me out of here?
When I'm staring down the barrel
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I cannot see your face?
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I'm blinded by the lights
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Just stay where you are
Let your fear subside
Just stay where you are
If there's nothing to hide
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
