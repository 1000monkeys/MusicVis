Flyover flyover
Chant
Flyover flyover
Step on the gas kick down the accelerator
Sing
Flyover flyover
Don't wanna get banged up don't wanna get captured
Chant
Flyover flyover
Step on the gas kick down the accelerator

Flyover flyover
Mr. Transmetropolitan get out of my way
There ain't enough hours in my day
The city's on fire in the pouring rain
Steam is rising faster than a runaway train
In the battle on the streets you fight computers and receipts
In a bloody turf war between Prada Gucci
A killer behind the wheel who ain't never going home
Skidding and sliding outside the transit zone
Flyover flyover
Step on the gas kick down the accelerator
Flyover flyover
Don't wanna get banged up don't wanna get captured
Flyover flyover
Step on the gas kick down the accelerator
Flyover flyover
Don't wanna get banged up don't wanna get captured
Speeding through the invisible 20 percent
Watch the race between the guilty and the innocent
Rubbing shoulders with the su-su-superclass engines
Burning up the hoorahs in South Kensington
Choking up London firing smoke into the air
Some days you'd rather be anywhere but here
Choking up London firing smoke into the air
Some days you'd rather be anywhere but here

Whoo
The city is blind but it will not slow down
The drive to destruction is the heaviest sound
The city is blind but it will not slow down
The drive to destruction is the heaviest sound
Is the heaviest sound
Is the heaviest sound
Flyover flyover
Is the heaviest sound
Flyover flyover
Step on the gas kick down the accelerator
Switch to the underground and it's another story
As the sound surrounds you with positive energy
As the bass line pud-a pump-pumps creativity
I said you know this is the place to be
You know it's always been the place to be
You know it's always been the place to be
I said you know this is the place to be
I tell em tell em London city
Flyover flyover
Step on the gas kick down the accelerator
Flyover flyover
Don't wanna get banged up don't wanna get captured
Don't wanna be down in the station at the stroke of midnight
You only wanna go where there's plenty of light
Asking for directions man they tell ya wrong way
You know there's never time
You know there's never enough hours in the day
You know there's never enough hours in the day
In the day
In the day
The city is blind but it will not slow down
The drive to destruction is the heaviest sound
