Out of your life and into your mind
Dividing lines
Someone forgotten, something inside
Somewhere in time
This lasting sight
Never more than a sound
So vile and infectious
A lucid recount
Аnd I never say what you want me to say
When I tell you everything's gonna fade
Аnd I’ll never be what you want me to be
When I’m in the misery that we've made
The misery that we've made!
And when will I know?
And when will you tell me (When will you tell me?)
What we already know?
This is all temporary
I, I was in doubt
Whenever you were around
Denial and acceptance with or without
Аnd I never say what you want me to say
When I tell you everything's gonna fade
Аnd I’ll never be what you want me to be
When I’m in the misery that we've made
When I'm in the misery!
Аnd I never say what you want me to say
When I tell you everything's gonna fade
Аnd I’ll never be what you want me to be
When I’m in the misery that we've made
Misery!
And I'll never be what you
Want me to be
When I'm in the misery
