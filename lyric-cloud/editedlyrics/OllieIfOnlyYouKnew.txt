Losing my head, think I’m falling for you
If only you knew the way that I feel, but you don’t got a clue
If only you knew, if only you knew
The shit that I do, if only you knew
If only you knew how I think about you, yeah, yeah

I've seen you 'round before
I noticed soon as you walked in the door
You looking good and you know that you are
I lost control, now, baby, I'm falling for sure
I don't know what they saying
Feel like I'm on vacation
Oh, man, this room hot right now
I'm just over here pacing
'Cause I don't know what I should do next
I never thought that I could be so silent

Losing my head, think I’m falling for you
If only you knew the way that I feel, but you don’t got a clue
If only you knew, if only you knew
The shit that I do, if only you knew
If only you knew how I think about you, yeah, yeah

I know you get this a lot
I'm staring at you hoping that I get caught
Maybe then you'd know just what I want
But—but, then again, I'm probably lost in my thoughts
That's the thing about me
I'm pretty good at dreaming
No, I'm not who I seem
Lately, I'm changing like the season
So, come on, give me a shot
I know I'm sounding crazy
But I just want what I want, I'm way too used to faking
So let me show you what’s real
And the way you suppose to feel
Not that bullshit on some movie screen, it's your heart I'm tryna steal
Swear, these are more than words—more than this paper and the pen
I can show you 'round the world
You can be my Alexis Ren
I'd give you all my time
You're always stuck in my mind
Barely even know you
But I'm seeing all the right signs
So, baby, don't go too far from me
Pretty soon you'll see that I'm

Losing my head, think I’m falling for you
If only you knew the way that I feel, but you don’t got a clue
If only you knew, if only you knew
The shit that I do, if only you knew
If only you knew how I think about you, yeah, yeah
