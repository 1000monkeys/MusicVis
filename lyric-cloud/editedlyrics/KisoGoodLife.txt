Raise up a cup up for all my day ones
Two middle fingers for the haters
Life's only getting greater
Straight up from nothing we go
Higher than the highest skyscraper
No Little League, we major
The proof is in the paper

We put the good in the good in the good life
We put the good in the good in the good life
We put the bad in the past, now we're alright
