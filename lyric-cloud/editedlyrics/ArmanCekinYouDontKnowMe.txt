Can't breathe, can't
Can't breathe, can't breathe
Can't breathe, can't
Can't breathe, can't breathe

I don't sleep
'Cause I think too much, I drink too much
Yeah, I feel too much
I can't breathe, when you look at me
'Cause all I see, is the blurry sense
Of what you think of me, hey
Yeah, what you think of me, hey

Why should I try to impress you?
'Cause you don't know me
You don't know me
When you, say my name it's empty
'Cause you don't know me
You don't know me
Anymore


You haven't seen
Me like this at all and all you know
Of me has gone away somehow
And it's a shame, to quit this game
But I guess it makes things easy, hey
Does it make things easy, hey?

Why should I try to impress you?
'Cause you don't know me
You don't know me
When you, say my name it's empty
'Cause you don't know me
You don't know me
Anymore


Can't breathe, can't
Can't breathe, can't breathe
Can't breathe, can't
Can't breathe, can't breathe
