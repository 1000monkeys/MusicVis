When I look back, I see trails of myself
Coulda been you, coulda been someone else
All that I know is I'm leaving that person behind

Oh, woah
I'm clean
(I've washed it all away)
I'm so clean
(You made me this way)
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams
Cuz I know that you want me clean

You gave me a taste of a life I could lead
You gave me a face for the fools to believe
Now I'm changing, becoming one of you

Oh, woah
I'm clean
(I've washed it all away)
I'm so clean
(You made me this way)
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams
Cuz I know that you want me clean

Woah
This life, oh, it's a dirty life
But I can show you another way
Woah
Don't you wanna be like me?
Don't you wanna be clean?

Now I'm the darkness that hides in the light
And it's laughable watching you put up a fight
The door's always open it's only a matter of time

Oh, woah
I'm clean
I'm so clean
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams
Cuz I know that you want me..
I’m clean
(I’ve washed it all away)
I’m so clean
(You made me this way)
Now I’m ready to be
The face that never screams
Cuz I know that you want me clean
(Cuz I know that you want me clean)
