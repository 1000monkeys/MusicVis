Talking noise, haters voices
Trying to put us down
Let them see, that we don’t need them
They wanna be us now

Cause when we’re pumpin' our fists and we're fired up
We give them jokes been like this till we’re taking off
They be huggin' and kissin' , you feel the love
Oh, I feel the love

Cause I know it’s only good vibes
When I got you next to me
I know we’re gonna bring back good times
It’s a way we’ve always been
Cause I know it’s only good vibes
When I got you next to me
I know we’re gonna bring back good times
It’s a way we’ve always been
I know it’s only good vibes

I know it’s only good vibes

Now we go, that’s how we go
Who will they to even judge
All I know is this ain’t a show
You and me are just having fun

Cause when we’re pumpin' our fists and we're fired up
We give them jokes been like this till we’re taking off
They be huggin' and kissin' , you feel the love
Oh, I feel the love

Cause I know it’s only good vibes
When I got you next to me
I know we’re gonna bring there good times
It’s a way we’ve always been
Cause I know it’s only good vibes
When I got you next to me
I know we’re gonna bring there good times
It’s a way we’ve always been
I know it’s only good vibes

Cause I know it’s only good vibes
When I got you next to me
