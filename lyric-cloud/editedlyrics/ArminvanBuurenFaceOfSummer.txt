Wandering alone
Caught at dusty dead end
Where are you now
Is there a sign you're sending
I want you back, I said I want you back
I was broken, such a fool then
'Til you looked my way
I was dreamin', now I'm believin'
You're my night and my day

You're the face of summer
I won't wait 'til summers gone
Don't let this fade away
I've headed down this road too long to discover
Standing in the light you and I side by side
You're the face of summer

You're the face of summer
Memories stole away
I won't wait 'til summers gone
Don't let this fade away
I've headed down this road too long to discover
Standing in the light you and I side by side
You're the face of summer
I want you to stay, let's walk into the sun
You're the face of summer
