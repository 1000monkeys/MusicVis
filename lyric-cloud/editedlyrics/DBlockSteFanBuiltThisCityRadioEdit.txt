On the day when this hologram will fade or subside
We will raise, We will raise
Wohohoo
In a place that our hands make their particles collide
We will raise, We will raise
A new flag every day
A new flag every day
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
Wohohoo
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
And we can tear it down
We built this city, built this city
We built this city, built this city
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
Wohohoo
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
Wohohoo
We built this city, built this city
We built this city, built this city
We built this city, built this city from the ground up
And we can tear it down
