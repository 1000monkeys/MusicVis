I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising
Open your arms and pray to the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire, or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Give me that rush
I want to show you what you've been missing
Am I enough to keep your other lovers hidden?

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire, or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Is it desire (
is it desire
), or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me
You need it now
You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me now

Is it desire (
it desire
), or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire (
I want desire
)
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Is it desire (
is it desire
), or is it love that I'm feeling for you (
that I'm feeling for you
)?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose (
oh, what you're willing to lose
)
