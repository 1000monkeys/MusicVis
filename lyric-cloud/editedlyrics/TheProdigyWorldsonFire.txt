(x4)
World's on fire, world's on fire
World's on fire, world's on fire
The world's on fire, the world's on fire
And it's too close to the wire

Your world's on fire, your world's on fire
And it's about to expire

Too close, you're too close
Too close, you're too close to the wire
Too close, you're too close
Too close, you're too close to the wire

You're so special, you're so special
You're so special, why aren't you dead?
Three, two, one, zero
Your world's on fire, your world's on fire
Your world's on fire, your world's on fire
And it's about to expire
Too close, you're too close
Too close, you're too close to the wire
Too close, you're too close
Your world's on fire

(x6)
Too close, too close
You're too close to the wire
Too close
You're too close to the wire
Too close, too close
You're too close to the wire
Too close
You're too close to the wire
