I've never been a quitter
But your love gonna pull me to the ground
See, I've always been a winner, yeah
People always try to take, take, take my crown
And I thought you were different
Beating to the rhythm of my sound
But you found somebody fitter, huh
And she let you down, down, down

In the middle of the night I see you crying, yeah, yeah
Now you're sleeping on your own, you're realising, yeah, yeah
Don't you know, you know you should've held me down
With all your might, begging for me to give you one last try
Why you crying? Yeah, yeah
Hush, baby, don't cry

You'll never find another, mmm
Another piece of luxury like me
You're such a motherfucker, mmm
You couldn't even make, make, make my tea
Guilty until innocent
It's a little bit too late to start and try
2% my lover, huh
98% was waste of time

In the middle of the night I see you crying, yeah, yeah
Now you're sleeping on your own, you're realising, yeah, yeah
Don't you know, you know you should've held me down
With all your might, begging for me to give you one last try
Why you crying? Yeah, yeah
Hush, baby, don't cry
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
Hush, baby, don't cry
Oh, ooh
Hush, baby, don't

Say goodbye, I'll be on my way, na-na-na
Don't you cry, it will be okay, na-na-na
Say goodbye, now be on your way, yeah-yeah-yeah
Don't you cry, it will be okay, be okay, it will be okay, yeah
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
Hush, baby, don't, uh
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na

In the middle of the night I see you crying, yeah, yeah
Now you're sleeping on your own, you're realising, yeah, yeah
Don't you know, you know you should've held me down
With all your might, begging for me to give you one last try
Why you crying? Yeah, yeah
Hush, baby, don't cry
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Hush, baby, don't
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Hush, baby, don't cry
