I want you to take over control
I think it's time to let you know
The way I feel when you take hold
One single touch from you I'm gone
Still got the rush when I'm alone
I think it is time I let you know
Take all of me I will devote
You set me free and my body's yours
It feels the best when you're involved
I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take over control
Whoa-a-a, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on!
I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take over control
Whoa-a-a, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on!
I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take over control
Whoa-a-a, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on!
Baby, baby, can't you see
That I'm giving all of me?
So it's up to you, now
We could let time pass away
I'll make an excuse to play
But it's up to you now
Just wanna fullfil your needs
While you're taking over me
So, what do you want now?
Take a picture, make a show
'cause nobody has to know
All the ways that we get down
I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take over control
Whoa-a-a, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on
Uh-whoa-a-a, uh-whoa-a-a-a
Plug it in and turn me on
Uh-whoa-a-a, uh-whoa-a-a-a
Plug it in and turn me on
Uh-whoa-a-a, uh-whoa-a-a-a
Uh-whoa-a-a, uh-whoa-a-a-a
Plug it in and turn me on!
