I keep on runnin' from my own life
Because I'd rather not fight
It chases me soon as it's daylight
And well through the night
But I can never stop wasting all my time with you
Now I can never stop wasting all my time with you
I feel alright when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel alright when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
Na-na, na-na
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
Na-na, na-na
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I'm tryin' to help myself feel okay
I know I won't be today
All of these thoughts will never go away
I guess I shouldn't complain
But I can never stop wasting all my time with you
Now I can never stop wasting all my time with you
I feel alright when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel alright when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
Na-na, na-na
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
Na-na, na-na
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel alright when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
I feel alright when I don't see ya
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
Na-na, na-na
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
Na-na, na-na
Stay in the back of my, back of my mind
