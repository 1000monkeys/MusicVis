Call me mystery
I mystify
 me feel 
I mystify

And now I'll rise above you


You can never say what I have lost
You can never guess where I've been down
I can never break something that ain't wrong
Baby come and chase what I have in store
I can never break something that ain't wrong
Baby come and chase what I have in store

And now I'll rise above you


Call me mystery
I mystify
 me feel 
I mystify
 I'll rise above you
