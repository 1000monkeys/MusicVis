Been wearing life like it’s a noose around my neck
Hunting vultures as they fly
Every spring, a flower blossoms in my hand
And every winter time it dies

I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted, the hunted, the hunted

I’m gonna press my frantic hand against your chest
Just to feel your beating heart
But soon I want vital systems to connect
Our universe follows two paths
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted, the hunted, the hunted

I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted, the hunted, the hunted

I’m gonna press my frantic hand against your chest
Just to feel your beating heart
But soon I want vital systems to connect
Our universe follows two paths

I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted
I've become the hunted, the hunted, the hunted
