"You wanna be all up in my face and shit, eh?
Well, okay, I'm crazy – see me go psycho, fuckin' psycho"

I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be
I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be

Simple advice, I'm not simple nice
I got no dimple, so you can call me Kimbo Slice
I'm not in for ice, maybe for bimbo twice
You're fully limbo when I rise, mistaken him for Christ
I'm in for no price, but the Earth Day shaky
Gave me birth – not again, another birthday cake
I never heard they make, but a nerve they break
So I'm curvin' they today, because I heard they fake
And you will never see me patient
I need to cover up, like eczema on the TV station
Imitations are the base reason I don't talk to people
My finger all up in your face like you're Doctor Evil
I'm all about the instrumentals, drum kits and a capellas
But I can stab you, like drunk kids are acting jealous
And my armpits aren't covered in Perry Ellis
I got more curved shit coming out of me than hairy fellas

I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be
I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be
(Yeah, yeah)

Your boys can feel that you're very nervous
'Cause I got more points on waves than a ferry service
And they reserve this, all they found was your ankles and feces
They can't strike your handle at my Glago pieces
Leave you dark orange, like timberland's age
They pull us in cages, but I'm ridiculous rage
Askin' for a nickel and change, I still never will change
I'll carn you for air, call me Nicolas Cage
And if you sue me? Sure, go ahead, I'll face the jurat
Come out and do the trial, like I'm Ace Ventura
All up in your face, stress you, your face mature up
Embraced up in the case I subways, like Jared, nah!
But look, I'm bigger than that
I got more filters for the bad than a cigarette pack
An eagle attack, use legs like a kicker on track
You'll shake like body-builders triggered on crack

I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be
I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be

I'm stabbin' them up, stabbin' them up
You're comin' to rap it, I'm makin' them up
Makin' them buck, nacked and fuck
If they're makin' them breakin', I'm makin' them talk
Stackin' them up, no pill in, makin' it real, I'm not a poking tack
Rackin' them up and kill 'em, makin' them feel it, like a broken back
You better be killer-beef, you be fuckin' with my type of honey
Better be killin' me, if you gonna be fillin' me for money
That reed for money, that cocaine, that kill for money
But I ain't here for that, so what the fuck you think I'm here for, dummy?
It's battle rap, finna be killin' beat, makin' the heat
Fuck you with the street, finna be gettin' the sweet, what you need?
But *brr*, wait, soon as I contact
Yabbedy, yabbedy, yabbedy, as soon as I come back
Like I pull the gun back, you stutter
Use a stunner, you stompin' an abused up gutter
Step in and bust in, cousins, step in and bust in, I'm not fussin'
Step in and cause 'em, cousins, step in and bust 'em, burn like poncin'

I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be
I'm always up in your face if you fuck with me
You cannot be traced when you buck with me
That's why they say I'm crazy, I go fuckin' psycho – that's who I be
