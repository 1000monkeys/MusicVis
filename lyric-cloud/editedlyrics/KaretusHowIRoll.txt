(Chorus)
Say Oh
Smashed up our last show
Had them screaming out for more
'Cus thats just how I roll
And I know that its my time
When the spotlight hits I'll shine
'Cus thats just how I roll
That-That-Thats Just how I roll x2
(Verse 1)
Nah
They don't want it with A.L
Skinny mother fucker but hit 'em like
Pow-p-p-p-pow-pow-pow
Wiki- wild, wild west
Come to the city
Where they put you straight to the test
Their like
(brap)
They don't want it with me
While their rolling with some U & I's
I'm rolling with G's
(whoo)
I got the swing in my genes/jeans
True religion so i'm the only one you'll ever believe
Say Oh
Smashed up our last show
Had them screaming out for more
'Cus thats just how I roll
And I know that its my time
When the spotlight hits I'll shine
'Cus thats just how I roll
That-That-Thats Just how I roll
(Hook)
Tek time
Why you watching me?
3rd degree flow and you ain't hot for me
All these rappers wanna floss without a pot to pee x2
I tell 'em Tek time
Why you watching me?
3rd degree flow and you ain't hot for me
All these rappers wanna floss without a pot to pee x2
(Chorus)
Say Oh
Smashed up our last show
Had them screaming out for more
'Cus thats just how I roll
And I know that its my time
When the spotlight hits I'll shine
'Cus thats just how I roll
That-That-Thats Just how I roll
(Verse 2)
I say
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I spit that fire
Hit 'em with that helium flow
I've got them higher
Ain't heard of us then you don't know what your missing
If rappers can't stand the heat get out the kitchen
Hit 'em with that ice box
Spitting that nice VOX
Their wishing they could freeze time
But, I got that ICE watch
And so I say
You don't wanna come down straight up
You don't wanna another man down
(Chorus)
Say Oh
Smashed up our last show
Had them screaming out for more
'Cus thats just how I roll
And I know that its my time
When the spotlight hits I'll shine
'Cus thats just how I roll
That-That-Thats Just how I roll
