[Verse 1 - Nicholas Gale & 
Hailee Steinfeld
]
Hey, we got a good thing
Wish I had you right here with me
All day, that I'm thinking
That it ain't gotta be that way
All that I'm seeing
Is your face on a phone screen
With a call and a message
Maybe we gon' be ok

Oh, you gotta notice
I hear explosions
Whenever I see your face on my pillow

I swipe right, cause I see just what I like
Baby, I tap twice for you
I swipe right, cause I see just what I like
Baby, I tap twice for you
Cause we're living in a new age
It's called digital
It's called digital love, love

It's called digital, it's called digital
It's called digital, it's called digital

It's late and I been drinking
So tired from working on the weekend
All day you had me wishing
That you would just show up my way
Gotta room, and no it ain't much
But it's warm undercover when it's just us
We could turn our phones off
Lie in bed and let the radio play

Oh, you gotta notice
I hear explosions
Whenever I see your face on my pillow

I swipe right, cause I see just what I like
Baby, I tap twice for you
I swipe right, cause I see just what I like
Baby, I tap twice for you
Cause we're living in a new age
It's called digital
It's called digital love, love
Cause we're living in a new age
It's called digital
It's called digital love, love

It's called digital, it's called digital
It's called digital, it's called digital

Oh, you gotta notice
I hear explosions
Whenever I see your face on my pillow
