There's something
I want you to know (Oh oh oh)
The world's a cold dark place
And nobody knows just where they're going

When they yelling racist slurs at yah
And you know that nothing really matters
You can use your words like a hatchet
To chop away the lies of life

Cause...
They ain't gonna be here
They ain't gonna be here
They ain't gonna be here
They ain't gonna be here
So long...
But you are gonna be here
You are gonna be here
You are gonna be here
You are gonna be here
Singing that song
It's true, do it for you

They ain't gonna be there so long
But you are gonna be there singing that song
If they wanna live that hateful life
You are gonna stand for what is right
They ain't gonna be there so long
But you are gonna be there so strong
If they wanna live that hateful life
You are gonna stand for what is right

When they yelling racist slurs at yah
And you know that nothing really matters
You can use your words just like a hatchet
To chop away the lies of life
The lies of life
I wish it were more straight forward so I could make the pain just go away
But I can't...

They ain't gonna be here
They ain't gonna be here
They ain't gonna be here
They ain't gonna be here
So long..
But you are gonna be here
You are gonna be here
You are gonna be here
Singing that song
It's true, do it for you

They ain't gonna be there so long
But you are gonna be there singing that song
If they wanna live that hateful life
You are gonna stand for what is right
They ain't gonna be there so long
But you are gonna be there so strong
If they wanna live that hateful life
You are gonna stand for what is right
