You, have got me on broken high
And neither of us
Wanna come down
They're telling me
That I might be crazy
They're telling me
There's no way out
So I half forgot I aspire, to be so much ore
I'm higher, than never before
I never, wanted anything more
This high I feel, it's not for real, no
It's not enough, I'm lost to love
This high I feel, it's not for real, no
It's not enough, I'm lost to love
