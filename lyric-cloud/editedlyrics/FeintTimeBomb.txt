Waiting
It's past one o'clock and I'm out of time
Can't undo the lock and no key to find
Looking all around at the station, "Are we frozen?"
Failing
To understand how I can hear your mind
Racing on and on through the years of time
Future is their home and I need to get back to mine

Listen, I've done this often
I've never had an issue with this machine in motion
The clocks in the walls are numb
And I've been waiting here for so long, so long
Listen, I've got a problem
And you're the only who knows this room has a function
Stay eighty years ahead
And live this life without you instead
