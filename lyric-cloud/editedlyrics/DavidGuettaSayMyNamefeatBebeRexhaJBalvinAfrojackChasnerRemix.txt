You've been dressing up the truth
I've been dressing up for you
Then you leave me in this room, this room
Pour a glass and bite my tongue
You say I'm the only one
If it's true, then why you running, you running

Oh-woah-oah
If you're really being honest
If you really want this (oh-woah-oah)
Why you acting like a stranger?
What's with your behavior? (oh-woah-oah)

Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you
Say my name, say my name
I am dying to believe you
I feel alone in your arms
I feel you breaking my heart
Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you

I got darkness in my head
Don't believe a word you said
Still I let you in my bed, my bed (yeah)
Got too many different sides
Got dishonor in your eyes
Something has to change tonight, tonight, tonight

Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you
Say my name, say my name
I am dying to believe you
I feel alone in your arms
I feel you breaking my heart
Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you

Yeah, yeah
