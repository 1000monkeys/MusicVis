Burned-up cigarettes
And all those broken things
Weight of our regrets
From all those broken things
The city don't sleep
So how will be ever dream
Out on the street
Is all you can be
{Chorus]
Don't stop
You've got
Something real electric baby
Hypnotized by what you got electric baby
We could light this dark dark city up
Keep it electric baby
Keep it electric
Don't stop
You've got
Something real electric baby
Hypnotized by what you got electric baby
We could light this dark dark city up
Keep it electric baby
Keep it electric

I feel it all
The reasons you can't go on
The things that you see
Will follow you home

Burned-up cigarettes
And all those broken things
The weight of our regrets
From all those broken things

Don't stop
You've got
Something real electric baby
Hypnotized by what you got, electric baby
We could light this dark, dark city up
Keep it electric, baby
Keep it electric
Don't stop
You've got
Something real electric baby
Hypnotized by what you got, electric baby
We could light this dark, dark city up
Keep it electric, baby
Keep it electric

Keep it electric, baby
Keep it electric
Keep it electric
Don't you ever let it go
Keep it electric
Don't you ever let it go
Keep it electric
Don't you ever let it go
Keep it electric
Don't you ever let it go
Keep it electric
