I got my bags packed and I'm ready to go
Tell me one damn thing I ain't already know
Got my bags packed and I'm ready to run
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
Saw a gun
Someone hits the floor
She tell me, "Better step back from that open door"
Got my bags packed, can't take no more
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

My lady caught me
Yeah she caught me
Yeah she caught me with another woman in my bed
She got the gun out of the closet
Yeah she cocked it and she put the barrel to my head
She said, "You told me that you loved me last night
I should've known that you would never act right
Oh, lord
Give me a reason to believe in you
And tell me why I shouldn't go and end your life"

I got my bags packed and I'm ready to go
Tell me one damn thing I ain't already know
Got my bags packed and I'm ready to run
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
Saw a gun
Someone hits the floor
She tell me, "Better step back from that open door"
Got my bags packed, can't take no more
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

I tried to tell her
Tried to tell her
Tried to tell her she's the only woman in my plans
But then my side chick started getting violent
And tried to pull the piece from her hand
The shot was loud and then the flash so bright
That I was blinded nearly lost my sight
Oh, lord
Couldn't do nothing, nah, I never saw it coming
Hit the ground running for my life

Oh, I got my bags packed and I'm ready to go
Tell me one damn thing I ain't already know
I got my bags packed and I'm ready to run
Mmm
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
No, I never meant to hurt nobody
No, I never meant to hurt nobody
No, I never meant to hurt nobody
No
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
