Force me to love myself
Ten times the weight
Like a widow weighing down her faith
Force me to find myself
Ten times the haze
On the other side I found my way

No one has to know
That I will go this far
I know it inside as I hold my heart for you
That I will go this far
No one in life who will know
That I will lose
It all

Force me to love myself
Ten times the cage
Like a borough closing down its gates
Force me to calm myself
Ten times the rage
With another word it just might break

No one seems to know
That I will go this far
I know it inside as I hold my heart for you
That I will go this far
No one in life who will know
That I will lose

Now that I greet the end
And go where I will go
Heaven inside my hands
I hope that I won't be alone

When I will go this far
I know it inside as I hold my heart for you
That I will go this far
No one in life who will know
That I will lose
It all
When I will go this far
No one in life who will know
That I will lose
It all

Such a clever way of nothing new
