Sick of being innocent
Sick of being ignorant too
I was in it for the thrill of it
'Til I started feelin' the truth

Why'd you ever make me choose?
I don't wanna be like you
I thought I knew you but
I never knew you would turn us into animals
I don't wanna be like you

Realized I'm living in Hell when I was given the news
Why'd you let the evil win?
How'd you let him sell it to you?
I remember growing up, mama used to sing me the blues
And now the kids are making noise
Just because it's something to do, to do, yeah

Why'd you ever make me choose?
I don't wanna be like you
I thought I knew you but I never knew
You would turn us into animals
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you

So now I'm second guessin' real life (
Ahh
)
And if you left I still wouldn't feel right
