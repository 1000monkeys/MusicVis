[Intro: Labrinth, 
Labrinth & Sia
]
All eyes on 
we
Let's run down streams of ecstasy (Yah, yah, yah)
September breeze, our clear blue skies are poetry (Yah, yah, yah)
Seven seas, we’re floating by the palm trees
 (Yah, yah, yah)
So 
come live your dreams in
Those simple letters, L-S
Those simple letters, L-S
Those simple letters, L-S
L-S-D
[Chorus: Labrinth & 
Sia
]
Uh
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
I see you
I’m here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
Oh-oh-oh
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
Welcome to the wonderful world of
I'm here on Venus
It's not what they told you, it’s
It’s what you told yourself
I'm here on Venus, woo
Welcome to the wonderful world of
I’m here on Venus
And now euphoria takes its revenge, come as you are

People of earth, boys and girls, children of all ages
Welcome to the wonderful world of
Labrinth, Sia and Diplo
