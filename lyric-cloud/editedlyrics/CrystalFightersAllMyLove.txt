Your shimmering, your shimmering
Light lit me up, I can’t deny it
I ain’t been this high
We off the charts
My flame you set my heart on fire
Feel us getting close, we’re going
For broke
We’re uncut diamonds shining from our souls
Til dawn....
Sitting on your sofa
Wanting to lean over, feeling far from sober, caught up in the flow i know I’m too nomadic, but we just got that magic
Feel us getting close if you want me let me know know know know...
All my love is yours
Am i wasting all my time singing
All my love is yours
Am i wasting all my time for you
You’re all I see
All I need
Praise the air you kiss, y’gold I live and breathe, I get
Flying sparks, crazy fantasies
When our eyes they lock, yeah darling when we speak
You’re all I’m thinking of (breath) all I need
And when I close my eyes you are my dream, soaring....
I know I’m too nomadic, but we just got that magic
Feel us getting close if you want me let me know know know know cos darling
All my love is yours
Am i wasting all my time singing
All my love is yours
Am i wasting all my time for you
Summertime is playing me a different cool, a different cool
Under nights of stars we’re shining lit by the moon, lit by the moon with you singing
All my love is yours
Am i wasting all my time singing
All my love is yours
Am i wasting all my time for you
