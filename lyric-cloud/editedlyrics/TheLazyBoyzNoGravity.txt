DK: ayyy
CN: shit nasty ain't it haha
DK:ik it haha
CN:Ohhh my god
DK; fuck it..okay
Hol' Up
I'm just living in my city
Where i got mad love for but don't see any (yeah)
Always gon be real but nowadays there aren't many (okay)
Say what's real keep it trill
But they even mixed up the meaning of real and trill (AHH)
I'm not just trying to get a deal (AHH)
I'm trying to make a point
In a crowd of people burnin beezys or a joint (SKEEE)
This is just how i feel (yeah)
I don't know what better way to make ya see it
Tell me all these lies like yeah imma believe it (get em)
Setting my goals and imma achieve it (whattt)
Holding on to our memories but pretty soon imma leave it (okay)
In the past
Behind me
Behind you
Always in it like a i do
But i do
Wonder if i had listened to my peers would things be different
But in person is when you wanna get different (ayy)
But me i'm still the same
Cut me off for a fucking lame
I was tryna ride but now you just swerving in my lane (where you at)
I ain't even gon say no name
This ain't a fucking game
So stop tryna play me
Don't wanna talk but when ya see me wanna Hey me
Man yall fugazy
Yall just lazy
It's kinda crazy
It's kinda funny how everything's hazy (get em)
But imma always be Davie
So yall can just hate me
Cause i'm speaking on what's real
Like people dropping a mixtape every month
Like i can't take you serious
You delirious (whatchall doin')
But i'm just serious
So it's gonna be more than a month to perfect my craft
Then i'm on a hunt
Yall just like to stunt
Man i'm just seeing double
Getting into some trouble
But i ain't talking bout all the girls i got (AHH)
Or this car i copped
I'm just reliving situations
Bringing back sensations
Thoughts that i should share (UGH)
Should've caught it at take care
But fuck it i'm at ya heart head neck (UGH)
I'm just tryna kill so that's a dead wreck
Or how bout a bed check (UGH)
But it's whatever
I'll do better
Leaving you with something to ponder
Catch the flow cause it's leaving something to make you wonder
Like leave them fuck boys behind and gon leave with me
Nobody's moving only thing leaving is a tree
BURN !
As i'm reaching for higher ground
I'm feeling so space bound
No gravity to stay down
Turn up the bass now (ayy)
As my eyes go so down
And my mind..opens up
You begin to see my inner visions..show up
Like i'm Stevie wondering so i got the funk
Know who got the blunt
No i'm on a hunt
I get it from the back when i'm in the front
Being single and seeing double i don't even stunt
No act on but i spit that script
Look at Davie boy spit that shit
Spittin that cold shit that you gotta decrypt
Don't even ask already know i'm equipped
If you about that action say something get flipped
We don't give a fuck you will get skipped
5 percent is the way i whipped

CN: ughhh
DK: whatttt
CN: you just murked that whole thing
Damnnn
Alright
Lets do another one..fuck it
