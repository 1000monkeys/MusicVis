You know I like talking, mmm
You listen to me
You hold me so tightly, mmm
But you let me be free
I get goosebumps when you call me
'Cause I think about when you touched me
In that closet at that party
Before we drank too much
Yeah, that's where it all started
In your studio apartment
'Cause your old couch and that carpet
They were made for us

Baby, I don't care 'bout money
I don't care about your past
I just want a love that's gonna last
You give me something I can feel, feel, feel
You give me something that is real, real, real (Ooh)
Baby, I don't care 'bout money
I don't care about your past
I just want a love that's gonna last
You give me something I can feel, feel, feel
You give me something that is real, real, real

You give me something that is real (Ooh-ooh)
You give me something I can feel (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You give me something that is real (Ooh-ooh)
You give me something I can feel, feel
Something I can feel, feel
Something that is real

Wherever you take me
It feels like it's home
And you could be 700 miles away
But I don't feel alone
I still remember that feeling
Where we stared up at your ceiling
I know you could hear my heart beating
Beating through my chest
Yeah, that's where it all started
In your studio apartment
And I don't gotta tell you
You know what happened next

Baby, I don't care 'bout money
I don't care about your past (Oh)
I just want a love that's gonna last
You give me something I can feel, feel, feel
You give me something that is real, real, real

You give me something that is real (Ooh-ooh)
You give me something I can feel (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You give me something that is real (Ooh-ooh)
You give me something I can feel
Something I can feel
Something that is real

When I'm with you, I can be myself
When I'm with you (Oh), there's nobody else
When I'm with you, I can be myself, myself

You give me something that is real
You give me something I can feel
You give me something that is real
You give me something I can feel (Oh)
Something I can feel (Ooh)
Something that is real
