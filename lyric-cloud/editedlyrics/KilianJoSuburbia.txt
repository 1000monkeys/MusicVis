You left with another boy
Playing games with the stupid girls
You should know that I noticed
Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you, I
Buying rings like you're a millionaire
Into songs that you haven't heard
You should know that I noticed
Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you, ah
(Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you, ah
Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you, ah)
When you're with Molly you are so cool
And you're not afraid to know her
You should know that I noticed
Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you, and
You're not afraid of danger
You run from suburbia
(You're not afraid of danger)
Why I'm crushing on you
That's why I'm crushing on you, ah
I can tell you're trying hard but surely don't see
So just forget about it, boy, you should be on me
No, wait, I could be wrong you got me thinking dirty
Why I'm crushing on you
That's why I'm crushing on you, ah
Talking shit you're so bourgeois
About your nights in Berlin
You don't care if I notice
Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you, and
You're not afraid of danger
Not stuck in suburbia
(You're not afraid of danger)
Why I'm crushing on you
That's why I'm crushing on you, ah
I can tell you're trying hard but surely don't see
So just forget about it, boy, you should be on me
No, wait, I could be wrong you got me thinking dirty
That's why I'm crushing on you, ah
Why I'm crushing on you
That's why I'm crushing on you, ah
Why I'm crushing on you
That's why I'm crushing on you, ah
(Still I'm crushing on you
Still I'm crushing on you)
