If you could only imagine what my shadow said
They keep on running me down and I'm folding in
I was stuck on my bad side
I'm just trying to find some peace of mind
Got my demons working over time
And I'm sick of feeling paralyzed

Away, my chest keeps breaking me down, I'm dying
There is no space
My cage is closing in like cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Closing in like cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Closing in like cold fire

Cold cold fire
Cold cold fire
Cold cold fire
Closing in like cold fire

Away, my chest keeps breaking me down, I'm dying
There is no space
My cage is closing in like cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Closing in like cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Closing in like cold fire
Cold cold fire
Cold fire

Cold cold fire
Cold cold fire
Cold cold fire
Closing in like cold fire

In noises, dark banners
Cold sweats keep coming up faster
This poison to my sanity and
I've been losing this part of me

Away, my chest keeps breaking me down, I'm dying
There is no space
My cage is closing in like cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Closing in like cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Cold fire
Ooooh oooh oooooh
Closing in like cold fire

Cold cold fire
Cold cold fire
Cold cold fire
Closing in like cold fire
