So you've been sleeping in his bed
Tossing and turning, I know it too well
Don't let those riches get to your head
I know you've been thinking of me instead

Oh, baby, you'll crawl back to me
'Cause, honey, he will never give you what you need
And when the devil comes to plea
He'll be running quicker than you've ever seen

Not me, I won't go down easy
Not me, I won't go down easy
Not me, I won't go down easy

Does he make you crazy like I do?
Keep you from dreaming the whole night through
I'm not a gambler, but I bet you
It's me you'll be kissing in that bedroom

Oh baby you'll crawl back to me
Cause honey evil will never give you what you need
And when the devil comes to plea
He'll be running quicker than you've ever seen

Not me, I won't go down easy
Not me, I won't go down easy
Not me, I won't go down easy (I'm not going down)
Hey!
Ohhhhhh!

Not me, I won't go down easy
Not me, I won't go down easy
Not me, I won't go down easy
