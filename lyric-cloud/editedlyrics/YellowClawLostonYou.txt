We talked about nothing at all all night
We slept till the Earth turned one time and woke in the dark
These walls stronger than steel and stone
Still we're waking all our neighbors up
Stay till the winter's done
Tell my friends I'm never coming home, aah

'Cause I'm lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
Getting lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you

Your veins are rushing with stars untamed
A shock to the heart, lighting
Your body's my drug
So bright you block the sun
But we keep waking all our neighbors up
Stay till the winter's done
And tell my friends I'm never coming home, aah

'Cause I'm lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
Getting lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
