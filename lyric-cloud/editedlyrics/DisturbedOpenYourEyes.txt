You're paralyzed
Breathe your disguise
You feed on the lies
That they tell you
Got to break away
From the numbing pain
Succumb to the rage
That's inside you
You're hypnotized
Demoralized
Believe every line
That they sell you
Start channeling
Whatever will remains
Discern from what's fiction
And what is true

(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?
(Hey! Hey!)

You've lost your sense
From the emptiness
You do as the headlines
Compel you
Become whole again
And let the war begin
Destroy the veneer
That surrounds you
There's no defense
For your recklessness
You stare as the proof
Lies before you
Why can't you see?
Are you afraid to be
Exposed to the demons
Around you?

(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?
(Oh-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?

You would all be running
In a world you cannot hide
And the end is coming
For the lemmings standing in line
Overcome it
Let the fury build inside
It could all be broken
If you only opened your eyes

(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?
(Oh-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
(Oh-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes?
