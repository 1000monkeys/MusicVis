Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated (to what you're demanding now)
Whoa,  oh
To what you're demanding (to what you're demanding)
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  ooh oh
I'm frustrated (to what you're demanding)
To what you're demanding
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  ooh oh (hit 'em wit a)


I'm hanging on to your hand so please don't let me fall
No control over myself I just might lose it all
A hard time understanding
All of the things worth planning don't add up to what you're demanding now
To what you're demanding now
To what you're demanding now
To what your'e demanding
To what you're demanding now

I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  ooh oh  (hit 'em wit a)


I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  oh
I'm frustrated
Whoa,  ooh oh
