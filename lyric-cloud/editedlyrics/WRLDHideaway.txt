Why don't you want to get up?
Take a walk in time
Waiting on a feeling
Wait all night
Why don't you want to get down?
Take a hit with me
Put your hands out
Let's go now

Just fade from the world that we once knew
And break down these walls that once stood still
And all we can say
Now everyone's gone

Let's hideaway, let's hideaway
Let's hideaway
Let's hideaway

Why don't you want to get up?
Take a walk in time
Waiting on a feeling
Wait all night
Why don't you want to get down?
Take a hit with me
Put your hands out
Let's go now

Just fade from the world that we once knew
And break down these walls that once stood still
And all we can say
Now everyone's gone

Let's hideaway, let's hideaway
Let's hideaway
Let's hideaway

Don't look, don't look
Don't look, don't look

You held my hand
I held the sun
Far away from the season
You hit your head
I hit the road
Far away from the seasons
