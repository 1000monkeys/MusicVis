Ah, icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
Need a bed
In Español
I said
Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
And I don't need a microphone

Icky Thump
With a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!
And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye
One blank stare
Looking up
Lying there
On the stand
Near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

White Americans, what
Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out
You're an immigrant too
Who's using who
What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too
Icky thump
Handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else
Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how
To clean up after myself
