So unashamed of the hurricanes that you caused
So unafraid, so untamed, a wild storm

Delicately fracturing my heart
Effortlessly tearing me apart

Nothing can protect me from your wild love
From your wild love
From your wild love

Delicately fracturing my heart
Effortlessly tearing me apart

Nothing can protect me from your wild love
From your wild love
From your wild love
From your wild love
Nothing can protect me from your wild love
From your wild love
From your wild love
Nothing can protect me from your wild love
From your wild love
From your wild love
