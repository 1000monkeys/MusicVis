It can't be easy holding fast to our dreams
City to city, moving at the same speed
Beauty is skin deep, looking for the in between
It doesn't take just anything to bring out the extreme

We live to keep score, for us it's run and go
For us it's all we know, it's run and go
We think ahead how to force out, we run and go
For us it's in our bones, it's run and go
We live to keep score, for us it's run and go
For us it's all we know, it's run and go
We think ahead how to force out, we run and go
For us it's in our bones, it's run and go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go ...

It's run and…
It's run and…
It's run and go…

We live to keep score, for us it's run and go
For us it's all we know, it's run and go
We think ahead how to force out, we run and go
For us it's in our bones, it's run and go
We live to keep score, for us it's run and go
For us it's all we know, it's run and go
We think ahead how to force out, we run and go
For us it's in our bones, it's run and go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go ...

It's run and…
