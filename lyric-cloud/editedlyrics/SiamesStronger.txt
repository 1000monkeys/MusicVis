Is it me?
Or I'm getting stronger
I was a man that I'll
Never be again

Is it me?
That I'm getting older
I tried so hard to get
Your love again

Is it me?
Or I'm getting stronger
But it's your name that I'll
Never say again

I tried to save
All the love you gave
But all the love you gave
Has disappeared again

(Never had) your heart
(Never had) your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
(Never had) your heart
(Never had) your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
And I...

Is it me?
Or you're getting colder
But it's your soul that I
Never saw again

I tried to save
All the love you gave
But all the love you gave
Has disappeared again

(Never had) your heart
(Never had) your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
(Never had) your heart
(Never had) your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart

(Never had) Never had
(Never had) I never had
(Never had) Never had your heart
(Never had) Never had
(Never had) I never had
(Never had) Never had your heart

(Never had)
(Never had)
(Never had)
