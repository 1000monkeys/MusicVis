If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now

I know you'll get stronger
When you get older
Just don't shrug your shoulders
When you get older

The things aren't easy
So just believe me now
If you don't keep it cool now
You'll never make a sound

All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now

Leave excuses aside
Speak out your mind
And don't let it slide
You're not always right

The things aren't easy
So just believe me now
Don't learn the hard way
Just let me show you how

All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now

If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
