Love, take it off
She love that dirty talk
Pushing her up against the wall
White wine and bubblegum

She got that rich girl L.A. vibe
She whip it good in her daddy's 95
Rough sex on the bedroom floor
Hop in the shower, she begging for more
Do not disturb on the hotel door
Waking the neighbors

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tanned skin, light eyes
Oh my, she’s so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time

We be running from the night time

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tanned skin, light eyes
Oh my, she’s so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time

She love to light it up
She smoke that lemon drop
Under the sun
Fill my cup
Ohh
Rosé and bubblegum

She got that rich girl L.A. vibe
She ride it good like she works it nine to five
Band tees and some ripped jeans
She a bad bitch, she be looking like Kylie
Blue eyes and green tea (she be looking like Kylie)

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tanned skin, light eyes
Oh my, she’s so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tanned skin, light eyes
Oh my, she’s so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time
