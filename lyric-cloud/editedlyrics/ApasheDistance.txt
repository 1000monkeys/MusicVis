Hm-hm, hm-hm

You don't even know what you like and you don't like
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

Oh 'cause I never really wanted you to notice
And I, distance myself from you
You don't even know what you like and you don't like
Oh 'cause you never even wanted to know this
And I, distance myself from you
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

You don't even know what you like and you don't like


Hm-hm, hm-hm
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

Oh 'cause you never even wanted to know this
And I, distance myself from you
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

You don't even know what you like and you don't like


Hm-hm, hm-hm
