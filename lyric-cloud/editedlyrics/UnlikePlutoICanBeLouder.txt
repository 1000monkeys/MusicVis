Stuck in the dark
They only show me what they want me to see, yeah
Backed against the wall
The anger slowly builds in me, yeah
It builds to a point where it starts to suffocate me
Just like a match
All I need is a little spark to set me off

I can be louder
Louder than you want me to be, yeah
This could be louder
Louder than you want it to be yeah

Most of the time I am the quiet guy
Calm and reserved
But I stand for what I deserve
I’m just a man who has limits when dealing with you
You were the spark that ignited all the flames inside me
And set me off

I can be louder
Louder than you want me to be, yeah
This could be louder
Louder than you want it to be, yeah

You’re the curse
You’re the worst, you’re in my head
I’m the Banshee
Hear me, I know you can
But now you’re complaining
I went too far
But you're the one that set me off

I can be louder
Louder than you want me to be, yeah
This could be louder
Louder than you want it to be, yeah
