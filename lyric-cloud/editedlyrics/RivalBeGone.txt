You, you just walk right out the door
Don't wanna do this anymore
Now I'm lost without you
You, drive me crazy out my mind
How'd you do this every time?
Now I'm lost without you

Used to be the one I talk to when I'm sad
Can't you see, now tainted love is all we have?

Our issues run so deep
Now when I try to sleep I feel so bad
I should leave, and by the time it's dawn
I'll be gone

I should leave and by the time it's dawn
I'll be gone

You're, so distant when you're home
Always hanging by your phone
Do I even know you?
And I, get paranoid sometimes
'Cause I know that you ain't mine
And I'm lost without you

Used to be the one I talk to when I'm sad
Can't you see, now tainted love is all we have?

Our issues run so deep
Now when I try to sleep I feel so bad
I should leave, and by the time it's dawn
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
