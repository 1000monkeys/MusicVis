Tour life, high times, blaze green, no crime
JDs, all mine, Jaeger Bombs, take five
No sleep ‘til sunrise, see the state of these eyes
Get messy, no lies, going hard every night (Jungle)
Our life is sick 'cause it’s fire that we spit
Making bodies move from the day we started this
Got ‘em bouncing, going insane, the kids lose it
Qemists and H, yeah, we’re taking over this shit!

In the jungle, taking over this shit
In the jungle, taking over this shit
In the jungle, taking over this shit
In the jungle, taking over this shit!

In the jungle, yeah! (What you gonna)

What you gonna do, soundboy?
Here in the jungle, we’re taking it over
What you gonna do, soundboy? (Yeah, yeah!)
Here in the jungle, we’re taking it over
What you gonna do, soundboy?

We got our foot in the door and we’re about to smash the hinges off
In a nightclub, on cruise ship, on tour, coast to coast we cross
From Sweden, to Finland, in season when it’s blazing hot
Stop off at the free town Christiana, get lean up find a spot (Jungle)
Bad boy from London, England that the police are try'n'a stop
'Cause after sound check my eyes drop, but anyway let’s get back to my job
Every day a different hotel key fob, got an itinerary, I can never keep up
It’s all love, I’m with my people gettin’ crunk

In the jungle, where’s my people gettin’ crunk?
In the jungle, where’s my people gettin’ crunk?
In the jungle, where’s my people gettin’ crunk?
In the jungle, where’s my people gettin’ crunk?!

In the jungle, yeah! (What you gonna)
In the jungle, uh! (What you gonna)
In the jungle, yeah! (What you gonna)
What you gonna do, soundboy?
Here in the jungle, we’re taking it over
What you gonna do, soundboy? (Yeah, yeah!)
Here in the jungle, we’re taking it over
