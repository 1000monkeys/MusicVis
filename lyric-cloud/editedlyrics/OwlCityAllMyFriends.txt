It's been this way from the start
It's like they're always trying to tear us apart
But we will stand strong, stand true
And everybody’s gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that I could take any more
'Cause I've been on my own, trying like never before
And I was lying on the couch and there's this knock on the door
And it's like...

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

Another day, another chance
We got our card and we're going to the dance
We're gonna stay strong, hold true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck, saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that we could take any more
'Cause we’re about to light a fire like never before
And if you're lying on the couch and there’s a knock on the door
It's like...

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

We'll always be young at heart
And nothing's ever gonna tear us apart
Because we stand strong, stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or you know what

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh
All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah
