Brothers in arms that share my fears
Time to protect what you hold dear
There's been a rise in new ideas
Threatening to change the way we live

Who knows what trouble's found a way?
Found a way to your door today?
Who knows what trouble's on it's way?
On it's way to intimidate?

All I want is a big red gun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot at the setting sun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And all I want is a big red gun
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot 'till the thrill is gone

Cause this is my right no matter the cost
Stay out of my sight when
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Oh yeah yeah yeah-yeah)
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Pride is a weapon in your hand
Freedom awards the faithful man
I hear the message loud and clear
Straight from his lips into my ears

And Lord I just can't walk away
Walk away from the enemy
The law will never disagree
On the target of my insecurities

All I want is a big red gun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot at the setting sun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And all I want is a big red gun
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot 'till the thrill is gone

And how many lives will have to be lost
To understand why my
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Baby's got a big red gun)
(Baby's got a big red gun)
(Baby's got a big red gun)
(Baby's got a big red gun)

We call them twisted and deranged
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
But we gave them the keys to annihilate
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
How long before the next one's in the ground?
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
So proud of all your history
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
But history made a big mistake
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
The judge and jury stand before you now

'Cus baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Oh, momma what have I become?
