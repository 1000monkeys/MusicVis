I know I'm no good for you
But oh what am I to do
You give me feelings that I can't ignore
you're the calm and I'm the storm
you're there with me
Coz I'm going through hell
Whether I'm with or without you
Baby I'm your Kryptonite
You're my superman superman
If we can make it through the night
We can do anything
Coz baby I'm your Kryptonite
You're my superman superman
Superman Superman
Superman Superman
Superman Superman
You're my Superman Superman
Superman Superman
Superman Superman
(I know I'm no good for you)
(But oh what am I to do)
(You give me feelings that I can't ignore)
you're the calm and I'm the storm
you're there with me
Coz I'm going through hell
Whether I'm with or without you
Baby I'm your Kryptonite
You're my superman superman
superman superman
superman superman
