There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No, oh time and space don't exist then
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place
Oh time and space
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to

I can feel the city crumbling around me
Can't seem to find my way
But I can see a bright light calling through the dark night
Hoping I'll find my way

Yeah, I had what I wanted
It went away so fast (fast)
Yeah, got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow (So, here we go)
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to

I can feel the heart beat underneath the concrete
Just like a kick drum plays
Running in a straight line, guided by the streetlights
Pushing the dark away

Yeah, I had what I wanted
It went away so fast (fast)
Yeah, got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No, oh time and space don't exist then
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No, oh time and space...
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to

Tomorrow
Tomorrow
We can dance
