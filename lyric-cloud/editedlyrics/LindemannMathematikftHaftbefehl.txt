Fuck fuck fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck her hard

I never wanted to go to school
I rather wanted to watch TV
Instead of adding stupid sums
Or subtracting or dividing
You won’t need any calculating
Why should I still think so much?
Why torturing oneself with numbers?
While there are machines to count money

Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck her hard
Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Algebra is not important

Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck her hard
Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Algebra is not important

I never wanted to go to school
Calculating roots, counts, integration
Geometry and these quotients
They are fucking useless later

Joint in the corner of my mouth
And I’m on my way to school
Eyes red like tomatoes
Kool Savas LMS in my walkman, whore

What Algebra, bitch?
I only know street maths
I learnt calculating by selling hash and weed
I put it on the scale and you pay me

Finally we need to write a test
The teacher is happy when we suffer
I only say what everybody thinks
You can skip on that maths crap

Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck her hard
Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Algebra is not important

Back then I came to school
But I was three weeks too late
My teacher said: Who are you?
I was like: Ah what are you trying to tell me?
I packed my bag full of drugs
Back then I was only fifteen
I threw my chair out of the window
And said: Bye, you sons of bitches

One plus one is two, two plus two is four
I don’t need to know more, yeah, that’s enough for me
Why torturing oneself with numbers?
While there are machines to count bucks

There are so many know-it-alls, that know it all
Those know-it-alls, they should fuck off
They can get together in their maths club
Have good grades, but shitty clothes

Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck her hard
Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Algebra is not important

Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck her hard
Fuck, fuck, fuck maths
Algebra is not important

We weigh money, we don’t need to calculate (no)
