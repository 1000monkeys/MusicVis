Verse 1 
Thought about this too much
What's there left to say?
Throw your stones, the river
Like me it drifts away
I would watch you stare
I would watch you stare
Oh-Ohhh, but there's no one there
Bridge 
We can figure this out
Put your feet down
Chorus 
We are the lucky ones
Swallow your choice it's done
Terrified of what's left
Remains, unsaid until you break my mind
Bridge 
Till you break my mind
Until you break my thought
Till you break my thought
Verse 2 
I'm throwing wishes in the well in hopes that
That you will keep them for yourself and know that
Now there was a time
When we never let go, never let go, oh we never let go
Bridge 
We can figure this out
Put your feet down
Chorus 
We are the lucky ones
Swallow your choice it's done
Terrified of what's left
Remains, unsettled till you break my mind
Outro 
Till you break my mind
Until you break my thoughts, till you break my thoughts
These sticks and stones will break me
They will break, they will break, they will break
