There's a boat sailing out there
To an island no one's aware of
We can go together and take to the sea
Sail with me
Sail with me
Every road lead us to somewhere
And every turn bring us closer to home
Being alone doesn't mean that youâ€™re free
So come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Every face is there to be looked at
Every word is there to be heard
Don't believe in all that you see
Just believe, believe in me
Believe in me
Sing with me
Sing with me
(Sing with me...)
There's a note waiting out there
For a song no one's aware of
No one's aware of
No one's aware
