Look in my eyes and tell me that you want me no more
What is the price, what is the price, how much do you want?
I'm too alive, I'm too alive to be out your world
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
Tell me no more

I'm too alive, I'm too alive
I'm too alive, I'm too alive
I'm too alive, yeah alive, alive
I'm too alive, too alive
Tell me no more

I'm skydiving my hearts driving we full throttle
Took us from a glass half full to a full bottle
I feel aliver than I've ever, ever, ever felt
100 miles whippin' down the coast to my brother's house
Money on my mind but I ain’t never got a single doubt
Look into my eyes and you gon' see what every sin about
Winner's route, used to barely eat but now our dinner's out
Catch us in the Ritz, I’m eatin' steak and all the spinach now
Bitch, uh

Look in my eyes and tell me that you want me no more
What is the price, what is the price, how much do you want?
I'm too alive, I'm too alive to be out your world
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
Tell me no more

Tell me no more
Tell me no more

Look in my eyes and tell me that you want me no more
What is the price, what is the price, how much do you want?
I'm too alive, I'm too alive to be out your world
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
Tell me no more
[Verse 2: M.I.M.E, 
2Scratch
]
Had a dream, put in work
Too alive and too alert
Break it down and built it up
Bitch we made it from the dirt
Bucking, ducking these obstacles
Jump into outa space
Callin' all in, not falling, I’m speeding setting this pace
Anyone test gon' meet my best
Anyone against that's self defense
Plenty wanna talk but can’t dispense
I’m cooling waitin' in suspense
I’m too alive, too real, and too right
Yeah I’ll be damned if I’m dying tonight
I'm too alive to be thinking 'bout my death (
I'm too alive
)
With every moment, every win, and every breath
Oh you and I ain't the same, I'm on a quest (
I'm too alive
)
Yeah every second, every minute, nothing less
I'm too alive to be thinking bout my death (
I'm too alive
)
Yeah every moment, every win, and every breath
Oh you and I ain't the same, I'm on a quest (
I'm too alive
)
Yeah every second, every minute, nothing less

Look in my eyes and tell me that you want me no more
What is the price, what is the price, how much do you want?
I'm too alive, I'm too alive to be out your world
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
Tell me no more

Tell me no more
Tell me no more

I'm too alive, I'm too alive
I'm too alive, I'm too alive
I'm too alive, yeah alive, alive
I'm too alive, too alive
Tell me no more
