Your soul is black
Your blood is cold
Your skin is rough
You have a heart of gold
Your face so dark
Feel clammy hair
Upon your flesh
Wet creatures everywhere
Gives me a shiver

Wild river
You stole my eyes
Never gave them back
You tried to kiss me
And sent a shiver
Round my neck
Wild river
Wet golden shrine
You sold my mind
And tried to kill me
Sent a shiver down my spine

You hate the sun
But rain is nice
You love the snow
But you are afraid of ice
Youâ€™re dressed in mud
Unsafe to dive
I want your gold
But you, you want my life
You want my life

Wild river
You stole my eyes
Never gave them back
You tried to kiss me
And sent a shiver
Round my neck
Wild river
Wet golden shrine
You sold my mind
And tried to kill me
Sent a shiver down my spine

You tried to drown me
Never mind to swim
And tried to eat me
Put a shiver on my skin
You tried to hold me
With million fins
And tried to heal me
Wash off my sins
Your kingdom come
We kneeling on the planks
All the trees bend over on the banks
Gives me a shiver

Wild river
You stole my eyes
Never gave them back
You tried to kiss me
And sent a shiver
Round my neck
Wild river
Wet golden shrine
You sold my mind
And tried to kill me
Sent a shiver down my spine

You tried to hold me
With million fins
And tried to eat me
Bite of my sins
You tried to drown me
Never mind to swim
And tried to kill me
Set a shiver on my skin
