I feel alive when I'm sleeping
'Cause they can't twist my words if I don't speak
But the world knows most my secrets
I feel alive when I'm asleep

And I haunt myself in the middle of the night
As I float through the frame of my body in my mind, oh
Everyone knows that I'm dying to feel fine
But the lens in my brain always tells me twisted lies

I see the world through a filter
And I'm just a different kind
I feel alive when I'm sleeping
I always hide on the inside

And I haunt myself in the middle of the night
As I float through the frame of my body in my mind, oh
Everyone knows that I'm dying to feel fine
But the lens in my brain always tells me twisted lies

Tells me twisted lies
Tells me twisted lies
Tells me twisted lies

I haunt myself in the middle of the night
As I float through the frame of my body in my mind, but
Everyone knows that I'm dying to feel fine
But the lens in my brain always tells me twisted lies
