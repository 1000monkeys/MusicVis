I am the horseman
I'm mentally mad
I am a super sharp shooter
Sittin' on a roof top
My name is MC H, I got the big breaks
And the bass
One, two, check
It's a mixture ruff to the core
Through the texture
Come and get a taste of the fixture
Yeah!
Yeah-ea-ea-ah, yeah-ea, I feel hardcore
Yeah-ea-ea-ah, yeah-ea, always hardcore
Want a lyrical sex
Ice and the platinum tech
With a minute in the game
When discover my necks
You don't fret
Me and my crew, we are too H-O-T
For any crew out there or any MC
Rippin' up the B you want H-A-T-E
Jealousy won't get you nowhere, I'm HP
Yeah-ea-ea-ah, yeah-ea, I feel hardcore
Yeah-ea-ea-ah, yeah-ea, always hardcore
All right
One world, one people, one music - one MC
Yeah-ea-ea-ah, yeah-ea, I feel hardcore
Yeah-ea-ea-ah, yeah-ea, always hardcore
