See, what some people don't realize is that
You can't stereotype my group as a hip hop group
Cause we do it all:
Hip hop, trance, pop, techno, rock, r&b
You name it - we've done it
It don't matter to me if a beat is hot, we gon' kill it!
We're here to make music bottom line
We have a whole lot of fans from different genres of music
So we gotta make sure that we keep a
Connection with them you know?
Connected like tetris

Drop the lights, shine the spotlight
Then give me the mic so I can get the crowd hype
And make 'em (bounce bounce bounce bounce)
It's B to the R O C (hi) from the D A C A V A L R Y (DaCav5) (bounce bounce bounce bounce)
Here we go now, to the people in the front: Get it up!
To the people in the back: Get it up!
To the people in the party: Get it drunk
Tryna get a buzz of that purple stuff
I guess you had too much cause you're spitting it
Passed out on the floor
You ain't getting up, 'bout to leave you there
Cause we're about to get it crunk up in here

We make music!
Some people call it hip hop, trance
Dance, rock and pop it don't matter - it's hot
We call it music, music, music, music
So we make songs that are catchy to keep you connected like tetris

A little bit of riddiling won't stop my rhythm
You gotta understand
I was meant to hit 'em with more tracks back to back
To stack on 'em moving the crowd by connecting genres
I'm not gonna stop this Hip hop, pop, rock, trance
Shake that ass, pop lock dance
Move your hands and  (bounce,bounce)
'Til the floorboard shift and you're feeling nauseous
Can't stand still and your back is arching
Be cautious cause more than often kids get
Bent to this music coughing
On the floor barfing, bobbing their head though
You never know
Who you're really gonna connect to
So keep moving nonstop, don't stop
Movement in music - It's hot!


Call it hip hop, trance, dance, rock and pop it don't matter - it's hot!
Shake that ass, pop that dance, it's hot! Dance, dance
It's hot! Dance, dance, dance
Give me the mic so I can get the crowd hype
And make them bounce
If you got a bubble butt make it bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
If you got some D-cups make them bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
If you got an applebottom make it bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Justine make them big ol' titties bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
