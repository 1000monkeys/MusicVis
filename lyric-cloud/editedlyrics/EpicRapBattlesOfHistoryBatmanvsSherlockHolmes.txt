EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
SHERLOCK HOLMES!
VS
BATMAN
!
BEGIN!

Nice hat
, 
dork, you look like a duck
I had Alfred
 
read your books
, 
he told me they suck
I'll crush your British nuts until they're bangers and mash
I've seen better detective work in Tango & Cash
You chump, I kick punks like you off the streets
While you and Velma here are solving Scooby Doo mysteries
Nothing makes me laugh, but I bet your raps can
So bring it on, bitch, 
I'm Batman!

I once met a rich fellow
 
who smelled of guano
 
and pain
(Holmes explain)
I deduce this deuce stain as Bruce Wayne
 
(The billionaire?)
Yes, his wealth would allow this adversary of ours
To afford the toys he needs
 
(Since he has no superpowers!)
You want a battle, bat? Bring it then
 
(I heard he has a British butler)
Good! Then he'll be used to getting served by Englishmen!
You're a wack vigilante black pantied spud with no skill
My sidekick's a doctor
 
(Because his flows are so ill!)
[Verse 3 - Batman and 
Robin
]
Shut up, nerds, I serve justice, so eat it
My sidekick only comes around...
When he's needed!
Boy Wonder
 
make you wonder how your ass got killed
Bite harder than those hounds down in Baskerville
I'll blast you with that bat-whack-rap repellant
Rappel a building, snatch a villain, then by dinner be chilling
Gotta secret about your homegir
l
 
Irene Adler
Took her back to my nest, to bam pow kersplat her
I'll shatter that fiddle with a chop of the hand!
Holy Conan Doyle,
 
let's get 'em! Aw god damn!
You're not smart, you're selfish, you endanger everyone's life
Why don't you let your boyfriend here go home to his wife?
Nobody likes you,
 
not your brother,
 
not your partner,
 
not Scotland Yard!
You'll die alone with no friends except that needle in your arm!

This mustn't register on an emotional level...
First, exploit childhood tragedy...then gesture with pipe...
Watson finishes punchline...next, acknowledge compliment
Conclude with killer catchphrase....
I believe your parent's homicide is why you mask your face
You're shamed and traumatized and haunted by the vast disgrace
Of watching like a passive waste as momma died and daddy was dispatched with haste!
 
(Holmes, you've cracked the case!)
You're a bat shit crazy basket case!
(Bloody good rhymes!)
 
I've got tonnes!
Dissing these dynamic douchebags was
 
elementary, my dear Watson
 
(OHHHHHHH!)
WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EPIC! (NANANANANANANANA) RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
