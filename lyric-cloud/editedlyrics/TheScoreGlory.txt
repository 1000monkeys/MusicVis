Glory
Glory

This is not another story
This is not another drill
I refuse to be another number now, never staying down
This is something real
I'm a name that you'll remember
I am more than just a thrill
I am gonna be the greatest ever now; watch out
I'm a force that you will feel

And it goes something like (Woo-ooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-ooh)
It's my time (Woo-ooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)

I'll be more than just a fable
I'll be written in the stars
I will never be too afraid to bleed, giving all of me
Even when it's hard
Oh, I started as an ember
Who was meant for kerosene
And now I'm raging like a fire, burning up
Through everything I see

And it goes something like (Woo-ooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-ooh)
It's my time (Woo-ooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)

When all is left is dust
They'll remember
Oh, they'll remember us
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the...
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh)

I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-oh-ooh)
