Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm
You told me hush, hush, baby, nobody will break you
Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm

You got me out when I dive too deep
The world is yours you said

I love you so, I love you so, I love you so

Arms as strong as the wind
Dressed ready to kill
Head in the clouds but feet on the ground
With you it's all safe and sound

Hush, hush, baby, and nobody will break you
Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm

I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
You gave me strength when I felt weak

I love you so, I love you so, I love you so

You gave me strength when I felt weak
You got me out when I dive too deep
The world is yours you said
You worried, you cared
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
