Emotions like summer
We'll wait for a blue sky
And I turn and hold you
As we watch the sunrise
'Cause this is amazing
Running wild with you
My thoughts are hazy
This may be way too soon

But I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh

I'm so lost in these summer nights
So lost in your crystal light
And even when this night is day
I won't regret the words I'm saying

Yeah, I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh

Through the longest of time, I will never let you go
(Never let you go, I'll never let you go)
If we fall off down the line, I will always keep a hold
(Never let you go, never let you go)
Through the longest of time, I will never let you go
(Never let you go, never let you go)
If we fall off down the line, I will always keep a hold, oh-no

But I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no!
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh
