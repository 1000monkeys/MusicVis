I close my eyes and pray for a break
(Uuuh, uuuh)
I can see everything going my way
(Uuuh, uuuh)
I take a deep breath as I hear my kids play
(Uuuh, uuuh)
And I know I gotta be brave
(Uuuh, uuuh)

You gotta have the patience
And believe you’re gonna make it
Gotta hold on
I know you’re crying on the inside
But you fake it ‘til you make it
Gotta hold on
You gotta have the patience
And believe you’re gonna make it
Gotta hold on
I know you’re tired of surviving
But you gotta keep on trying
Gotta hold on

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
You gotta have the patience
And believe you’re gonna make it
Gotta hold on
I know you’re tired of surviving
But you gotta keep on trying
Gotta hold on

I danced with the darkness ‘til I found the light
(Uuuh, uuuh)
In the shape of a woman she the love of my life
(Uuuh, uuuh)
Keeps my head up high she gives me all that I need
(Uuuh, uuuh)
She picks me right up when I’m down on my knees
(Uuuh, uuuh)

You gotta have the patience
And believe you’re gonna make it
Gotta hold on
I know you’re tired of surviving
But you gotta keep on trying
Gotta hold on

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
You gotta have the patience
And believe you’re gonna make it
Gotta hold on
I know you’re tired of surviving
But you gotta keep on trying
Gotta hold on

I’ve got the feeling I’m going
I’ve got the feeling I’m going
I’ve got the feeling I’m going places
I’ve got the feeling we’re going
I’ve got the feeling we’re going
I’ve got the feeling we’re going places

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
You gotta have the patience
And believe you’re gonna make it
Gotta hold on
I know you’re tired of surviving
But you gotta keep on trying
Gotta hold on
