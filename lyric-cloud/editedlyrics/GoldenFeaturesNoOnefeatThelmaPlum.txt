No one likes to feel on the quiet side
They just like to dance, makes us feel fine
Please just close your eyes and take you down, down, down
No one likes to feel on the quiet side
We just like to dance, makes us feel fine
Please just close your eyes and take you down, down, down

It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher

No one likes to feel on the quiet side
We just like to dance, makes us feel fine
Please just close your eyes and take you down, down, down
No one likes to feel on the quiet side
They just like to dance, makes us feel fine
Please just close your eyes and take you down, down, down

Remember how it happened, I felt alive
We were going downstairs after dark
We were only young
We were falling in love
And always there's a time, you see
Now you're not the one for me
We were seventeen, oh that boy was over me
We were fools, we were through
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
It's getting higher
