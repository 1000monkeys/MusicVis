Heart ocean wide
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
Dark open sky, is you know
Don't you know? Don't you know?
It's easy to let go, just let go
Breathing the echo, the echo
I'm 'bout to leave my heart ocean wide
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?

Finally I'm sure
Really, I don't care
Feeling like a I got this crystal ball
So whatever comes, I've seen it all

Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go
First until the last
I'm good to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go, good to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go
First until the last
I'm yours to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go, good to go

Fast falling snow
Alive, I'm alive, I'm alive (yeah)
The last autumn oh I survived, I survived, I survived
I knew from the get go, the get go
That we never let go, let go
It's fresher than the fast falling snow
Alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

Finally I'm sure
Really, I don't care
Feeling like I got this crystal ball
So whatever comes, I've seen it all

Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go
First until the last
I'm yours to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go, good to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go
First until the last
I'm yours to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go, good to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go
First until the last
I'm yours to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go, good to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go
First until the last
I'm yours to go
Ain't living in the past
I'm good to go, good to go
