After this, the rest is all bullshit
After this, the rest is all bullshit
After this, the rest is all bullshit
After this, the rest is all bullshit

I'm so down underground, I be scalping all my tickets
Forging all my sound scans like y'all can tell the difference
The mission fishin' for the disenfranchised little kids
We shoot 'em in a barrel--it's so easy when they're pissed
Under educated, extra caffeinated
I just masturbated, now I'm motivated
Can't live with us, you can't live without us
I take it then I break it, then you write my paycheck
You can call me Little Miss Piss with a kiss
And after all this the rest is all bullshit

And you love it
You love it
You love it
You love it


I'm bumping like a pimp on the stage to save face
I overcompensate with very bad taste
No offense, no romance, sick of your parents
I'm about to take a stance, in your daughter's underpants
It's no accident, you all pay my rent
And I am free to download all the porno on the internet
Carried on a stick, stick, not too fucking quick, quick
Now that I'm a prick, prick, y'all can jack my dick
Say no to brains--it's a no-brainer
Lowest common denominator
Pays the bills to be this sterile
Fuck me now, rip me off later



You can call me Little Miss Piss with a kiss
You can call me Little Miss Piss with a kiss
You can't live with us, you can't live without us
