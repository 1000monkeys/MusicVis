I heard you got arrested in the street last night
You called me with a voice I didn't recognize
So you're numbin' the pain, stuck in your ways
Since we were kids it was like this
But I will be there, I will be there for you

Hey child, hey child
We were born wild
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright
Hey child, hey child
We were born wild
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright
Oh, oh

Back in the '06, sellin' weed to the freshman kids
You were the yin to my yang, were never separate
And I know you've been hurtin', think you deserve it
How did it end up like this?
Everything will be fine if you just get through tonight

Hey child, hey child
We were born wild
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright, oh
Hey child, hey child
We were born wild
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Brother's got a baby on the way now
I hope that you'll meet him some day
I hope he don't make the same mistakes we made
And when I look at him in the eyes, I'll say

Hey child, hey child
You were born wild
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright, oh
Hey child, hey child
We were born wild
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright
Oh, oh

Hey, hey child
Oh, oh
Hey, hey child
You're born wild
(We were born, we were born wild)
Let your neon lights
Keep shinin' bright
Oh, oh
