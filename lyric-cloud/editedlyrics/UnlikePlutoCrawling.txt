There's no medicine
For what you put in
And I don't know, and I don't know
(Oh, I)
But I let it in
For that I repent
And I don't know, and I don't know
(Oh, I)

Like I was saved, from shit that you say (wish I, wish I)
Wish I could change, the words that you say (wish I, wish I)
There's no medicine
There's no medicine

Your words crawl into my ears tonight
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)
Hypnotized by parasitic lies
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)

(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)

Oh here we go, you’re dedicated
You celebrated
When you break me, when you break me right down
You’re killing me, premeditated
I’m devastated, when you leave me, leave me on the ground

Like I was saved, from shit that you say (wish I, wish I)
Wish I could change, the words that you say (wish I, wish I)
There's no medicine
There's no medicine

You're what's crawling to my ears tonight
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)
Hypnotized by parasitic lies
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)

(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)

Playing mind games, manipulate me
Operate me, surgical lies
You sedate me, drunk on a memory
Then it all fades, and I realize
You were only here for a while
(I don't know why)
Why'd you whisper nothin'? (Oooh)
When you need somethin’
You were only here for a while
(I don't know why)
Bye, then

You're what's crawling to my ears tonight
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)
Hypnotized by parasitic lies
(I'm crawling in, crawling inside)

(I am Crawling in, crawling inside)
(I am Crawling in, crawling inside)
(I am Crawling in, crawling inside)
(I am Crawling in, crawling inside)
