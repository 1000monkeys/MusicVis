Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
