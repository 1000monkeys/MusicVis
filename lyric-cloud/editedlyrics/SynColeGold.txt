Like Jay-Z, writing on to paper
Turning into green, and it's
23, that's my lucky number
Win the lottery

Yeah, I got a dream, I'll be chasing gold
No apologies, I'll be chasing gold
It's all that I need, until my stories told
Live a life of ease, I'll be chasing gold

I'll be chasing gold
I'll be chasing gold

Ooh, another day, another dollar
But I've got holes in my pockets
Oh, another day, another dollar
But I don't know how to stop it
Nine till five, lord they make you suffer, lord they make you bleed
And I, want that life, that I keep on seeing, in those magazines

Yeah, I got a dream, I'll be chasing gold
No apologies, I'll be chasing gold
It's all that I need, until my stories told
Live a life of ease, I'll be chasing gold

I'll be chasing gold
I'll be chasing gold
I'll be chasing gold
I'll be chasing gold
