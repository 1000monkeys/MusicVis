Flashback to the time in your life
When you thought it would be easy
But it's hard when you're take on the world alone
The one shot that you fire at the sky
Hoping someone else can see it
Just a sign that you're not out there on your own

We come one tonight
I've been waiting for your wake up call
Growing stronger now
I can hear it in a thunderstorm

We sing, oh oh oh oh oh
I don't want to do this without you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you

Some say you can never go back
To the city built for dreamers
But I know we can find it on our own
The one shot that we fire at the sky
But this time we are together
Right here in this moment where we belong

We come one tonight
I've been waiting for your wake up call
Growing stronger now
I can hear it in a thunderstorm

We sing, oh oh oh oh oh
I don't want to do this without you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
