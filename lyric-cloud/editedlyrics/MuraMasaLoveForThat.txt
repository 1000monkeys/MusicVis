Tell me, do you think I'm being sentimental 'cause
All this time, I've been tryna work out what it was
That brought me close to you, wish I could feel it now

They don't fall in love for that
They don't fall in love for that
It's all for you

They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for that
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for.. It's all for you
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for that
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for.. It's all for you

Baby, I'm not the one to help you make decisions 'cause
I need some time from you to know if this is best for us
If I don't think it's right, you'll think I'm wrong

They don't fall in love for that
They don't fall in love for that
It's all for you
London, let me see your lighters

They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for that
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for.. It's all for you
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for that
They don't fall in love for, they don't fall in love for
They don't fall in love for.. It's all for you
