Well we will never die
It should come as no surprise
We will always multiply
Never ever be denied

You know I never rock
You know I never roll
And just like Janet Jackson
I'll be losin' all control
You know I never rock
You know I never roll
And just like Michael Jackson
And just like Michael Jackson

I'll be white (yeah)
Suburban (yeah)
Middle-class (ooh)
I'll never have to work again
White (yeah)
Suburban (yeah)
Middle-class (ooh)
I'll never have to work again

I can always piss my life away
There will never be consequences
It doesn't matter what I say
Mommy's always gonna pay for college

Well we will never die
It should come as no surprise
We will always multiply
Never ever be denied

Because I'm white (yeah)
Suburban (yeah)
Middle-class (ooh)
I'll never have to work again
White (yeah)
Suburban (yeah)
Middle-class (ooh)
I'll never have to work again

You know I never rock
You know I never roll
And just like Janet Jackson
I'll be losin' all control
You know I never rock
You know I never roll
And just like Michael Jackson
And just like Michael Jackson

I'll be hard-core
Honkey Galore
No one I know
Has ever been poor
Even the police
They know the score
My daddy is a lawyer
And there's nothing that I'm sorry for
Retail stores
Liquor and whores
I got one black friend
And I don't want more
The only thing better
Than Star Wars
Is the Keytar solo
From 1984

(oh yeah, this is better than standing still at a Radiohead concert)
SHORT, TALL, GRANDE, VENTI

We will we will never die
It should come as no surprise
We will always multiply
Never ever be denied

White (yeah)
Suburban (yeah)
Middle-class (ooh)
I never have to work again
White (yeah)
Suburban (yeah)
Middle-class (ooh)

You know I never rock
You know I never roll
And just like Janet Jackson
I'll be losin' all control
You know I never rock
You know I never roll
And just
Like
Michael
Jackson
I'd be white
