[Verse 1: Aesop Rock,

Money on my motherfucking mind
Cop five haircuts at the same time
White gold pants, 
Jet Ski made of Yuan
Foie gras bust of Albert Einstein
Get money
Money out my motherfucking mouth
A mansion, a ranch, and a camp and a town
A motherfucking store with a floor made of scalps
Bobby from the block don't got
 
rocks, he got Alps
Get money
Money in the motherfucking jar
Shark fin pastry
, 
summers on Mars
Twenty motherfuckers in a levitating car
Seven-forty-seven full of women and cigars
Get money
Money in the motherfucking pot
A castle full of cars and the yard full of yachts
A leopard with a mink
 and an arm full of clocks
All hand wound everyday by a Spock
Get money

Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, motherfucker

Gotta ge- get
My mo- motherfu- fuckin' money
Gotta get
Gotta g- get
Gotta ge- get
My mo- motherfu- fuckin' money
Gotta get
Got- Gotta get, get, get, get, get
[Verse 2: Aesop Rock,

Money is a motherfucking joke
Forty bald eagles sewn onto a coat
Zoo with the crib, mermaid in the moat
Buy another strip mall every eighth note
Get money
Money ain't a motherfucking prob
It's a sport I invented to win when I watch
And own all the rights and the lights and the locks
Even own all the ice in the Sprite you just dropped
Get money
Money or your motherfucking life
Two ton angel carved outta ice
Alligator sailboat
, dollar sign eyes
Fill a warehouse full of Van Goghs twice
Get money
Money or your motherfucking heart
I could give it to my dog
He makes money when he barks
Or put it in my fridge
Or in one of my parks that I bought
So my robots could learn how to LARP
Get money

Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, motherfucker
