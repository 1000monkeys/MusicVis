I live in my dreams
Can't blame me for trying
Just a simple man
Swear that I’m not lying
If you could find a way
To take away the pain
Wouldn't you chase it?
Wouldn't you chase it?

Worked on through the night
Was filled with good intentions
To build a better mind
That was my invention
Thought I’d found a way
But now I'm losing faith
Why did I chase it?
(Why did I chase it?)

I created a monster
It's out of control, it's going to take me
I created a monster
I didn't know what I was making
I created a monster, oh-oh (oh)
I created a monster
But now it's coming, coming for all of us
Now it's coming, coming, oh

Thought I was a god
Obsessed with my creation
Yeah, I felt the power
Beyond imagination
If you could roll the dice
For a taste of paradise
Wouldn't you chase it?
(Wouldn’t you chase it?)

I created a monster
It’s out of control, it's going to take me
I created a monster
I didn’t know what I was making
I created a monster, oh-oh (oh)
I created a monster
But now it's coming, coming for all of us
It's coming, coming, coming, yeah
It's coming, coming, coming, for all of us
It’s coming, coming, coming, yeah
It's coming, coming, coming, for all of us

Where is my conscience?
Where is my salvation?
We've become the prey
And the hunter has no patience
There's nothing I can say
To make this go away
Why did I chase it?
(Why did I chase it?)

I created a monster
It's out of control, it's going to take me
I created a monster
I didn't know what I was making
I created a monster, oh-oh (oh)
I created a monster
But now it's coming, coming, for all of us
It's coming, coming, coming
(to take me away)
It's coming, coming, coming
It's coming, coming, coming
I created a monster
Now it's coming, coming, for all of us

I created a monster
