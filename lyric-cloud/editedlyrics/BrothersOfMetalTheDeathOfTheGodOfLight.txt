Out on the fields where the lonely horizon lies
So cold to the touch, every valley is made of ice
Fairest of gods, he was forced to be put on trials
Facing his end staring into the trickster’s eyes
Metal and steel, fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow
They all were repelled no matter the might
Nothing could harm him now
God of light so wise and strong
The fairest of them all
His downfall was a mistletoe
Now hope is bound to fall
Loki’s plan so evil and so vicious in its way
Now only tears can save the worlds from Ragnarök’s dismay
In search for the truth he came up with a grand disguise
One conversation that lit up his evil eyes
For Loki, the envy was too much for him to bear
A secret revealed of a flower with skills so rare
Metal and steel, fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow
They all were repelled no matter the might
Nothing could harm him now
God of light so wise and strong
The fairest of them all
His downfall was a mistletoe
Now hope is bound to fall
Loki’s plan so evil and so vicious in its way
Now only tears can save the worlds from Ragnarök’s dismay
Metal and steel, fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow
They all were repelled no matter the might
Nothing could harm him now
God of light so wise and strong
The fairest of them all
His downfall was a mistletoe
Now hope is bound to fall
Loki’s plan so evil and so vicious in its way
Now only tears can save the worlds from Ragnarök’s dismay
