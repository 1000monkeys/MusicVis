If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then baby let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love for the beats
Feel it in the streets
Love for the melody, notes on the sheets
The dope crusader, 
funky terminator
I created me a rocket just so we could rock it later
And the way the beat is knocking
Got me feeling (alright)
Cause the dj got me walking on the ceiling (all night)
I got a rocket for the globe, bomb it, just go
I fill it up and love it, and then I watch it explode

If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then baby let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love for the bass, and love for the treble
Love for the orchestra, violin, cello
Love for computer beats, harder than metal
House beats housing, bouncing in the ghetto
We sip till we smashed up, feeling alright
And we rock the ghetto blaster, rocking all night
I sent a rocket to the globe, bomb it, just go
I fill it up and love it, and then I watch it explode
Eh, baby, yeah, alright
Can you feel it?
Good god, yeah, alright

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
