A sight for sore eyes
To the blind would be awful majestic
It would be the most beautiful thing
That they ever had seen
It would cause such surprise
It would make all of their minds electric
How could anyone tell them
That some things are not what they seem?
In such disbelief
I thought I was asleep when I met you
My heart liquefied and I sighed
Oh this must be a dream
If I forget to set the alarm
And sleep on through the dawn
Don’t remind me
I’d rather be dreaming of someone
Than living alone

If you’re searching the lines for a point
Well, you’ve probably missed it
There was never anything there
In the first place
