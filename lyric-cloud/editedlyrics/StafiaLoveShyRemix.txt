(Baby baby)
(I'm a little love shy, baby)
Heya, heya, heya, heya, hey

Got to, got to get it, gotta be strong
Cause then my love will be coming
And I won't be love shy any more
Heya, heya, heya, heya, hey

I'm feeling kinda love shy he got me screaming
Up all night moves just right
In the club we hit his 
Got that rum and red bull light
Be the man just got kicked out
Had too much Jack
There's off to get a kebab
Gotta get a doner
(I won't be love shy)
Fat yeah but so what
It's off to the next bar wait
What's it called
I swear we've passed this end
The bouncer said fuck off but
Fuck it we're here now
Let's scream cheers now
Cause we've worked all year round
Time to let our hair down
Shuffle to some house
Then unwind to the bashment
(Hey hey hey hey)
The guy to the right
Got a  out his head
But he's still partying
What's your excuse then
Get up on the floor
Make that booty shake some more
Hustlers in the booths
So honey get your hustle on
And swing your draws
