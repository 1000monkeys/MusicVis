I am the tragedy
And the heroine
I am lost And I am rescuingThe storm is come
And I am followingMy name is Tristan
And I am aliveForever young
I come from God knows where
'Cos now Im here
Without a hope or careI am trouble
And I am troubled tooMy name is Tristan
And I am aliveSorrow by name
And sorrow by nature
Working for joy
On overtimeStuck on a line
Of misadventure
I fear no crimeI am the victim
And the murderer
You speak of love
But Ive never heard of herI am fucked
And I am fucking tooMy name is Tristan
And I am alive
