You say you are fine
But I see pain
Behind those eyes
You play the game
By the rigid rules
But you cheat yourself

There ain't nothing you can say
That would scare me away
I got history too
And it's never too late
Share a secret today
I reciprocrate
Baby, I got you

So hurt with me
I'll hurt with you
Baby, you know we can hurt together
I've been where you've been
I've seen what you've seen
So hurt with me
We can hurt together
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me

Someday you'll taste
The freedom and relieve
Of a trouble shared
Oh, oh
Today I'm here loving you
Confide in me

There ain't nothing you can say
That would scare me away
I got history too
And it's never too late
Share a secret today
I reciprocate
Baby, I got you

So hurt with me
I'll hurt with you
Baby, you know we can hurt together
I've been where you've been (I've been where you've been)
I've seen what you've seen (I've seen what you've seen)
So hurt with me (So hurt with me)
We can hurt together
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
