Well, I’ve been in love with love, and the
Idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I’ve seen time tell tales about that
Systematic drug, yeah, that heart that beats as one
It’s collectively, unconsciously composed

Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do

Well, I lost my head in San Francisco
Waiting for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud
It was smiling down

Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C’mon, c’mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
