When you come around, when you come around again
You better not come in, you better stay outside
Cause I can't hold my ground, I can't hold my ground, I can't
Not if you look me in, you look me in the eyes

Tiger in my heart again
When you swallow someone whole
You are bound to choke
Well I guess we can never be friends
I ate you up the day we first spoke

Give in, give in
I want you back
One heart, one too
Many to stomach
Love bites so deep
And we got tiger teeth
Give in, give in
I want you back
Keep count, one too
Many to stomach
Love bites so deep
And we got tiger teeth

Don't you call me on the telephone
Don't make plans with my friends
I think that it's best if you leave me alone
When I'm with you I just wanna play pretend
If you'd only take one step closer
I could reach the zipper on your dress
We're leaning out over the water
And we're holding our breaths

Tigers in our hearts again
When you swallow someone whole, you are bound to choke
I guess we can never be friends
I ate you up the day we first spoke
