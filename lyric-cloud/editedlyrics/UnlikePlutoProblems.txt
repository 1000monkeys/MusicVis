I find out
In the moment
This crowded room is filling me with doubt
I black out
In the open
So I stick to the walls, where I can live without you

'Cause I don’t want to be
Someone’s problem, huh
'Cause I don’t want to be
Someone’s problem, huh

Huh, huh, huh-uh
Huh, huh, huh-uh

'Cause I’ve been
I've been broken
I’ve been drownin’ in a frozen sea of ice
And I know
The monsters inside my head
Are never gonna die

'Cause I don’t want to be
Someone’s problem, huh
'Cause I don’t want to be
Someone’s problem, huh

Huh, huh, huh-uh
Huh, huh, huh-uh
