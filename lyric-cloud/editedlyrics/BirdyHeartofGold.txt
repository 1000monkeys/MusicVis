I can be strong when I want to be
You think I’m weak ‘cause you can tear me apart with the words that you speak
You think you’re in control
But you don’t understand how much you’re wrong
You choose to lash out at me, I’ve done nothing wrong
All you crave is attention and just to be loved
You need to be loved

And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hurt is just too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say "I love you"

Is there not enough to use your love for me
To get past the things that cause you envy and hate
And the fights that they bring
You say you're looked on as small
Can’t understand why you don’t have it all
But you don’t know how I fight for you and believe in your aims
I just want to do right by you, forget what has changed
‘Cause nothing is changed

And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hurt is just too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say "I love you"

But you don't have to be so mean
You’re such a drama queen
The way you play on every weakness that you see in me
To make you strong, you were all along
So don’t pretend like you can hardly breathe
Like it’s down to me
‘Cause it’s so unfair that you can’t suceed, boy you’re so wrong
We’re still so young

And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hurt is just too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
