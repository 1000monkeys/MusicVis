Got stones in my stomach and they're in my brain
You faded away and I lost my way
Too close to ignore, too far to talk to
Wrinkles around yours and tears around my eyes
At least it's getting late tonight and I
Wonder if you think about me sometimes
I got your words in my pocket but they're hard to bare
I started to cry and you didn't even care
Put my pain in the box that will be opened a lot
Times have changed since you held me in your arms

At least someone is laying down in yours
Can I ask, do you even miss me sometimes?

Do you even miss me sometimes?
Do you even miss me sometimes?
Do you even miss me sometimes?

You got your tears in the pocket and it's closed with care
You like me but I'm here and you're there
Judge me for being rude, cut the story left the queue
I have changed 'cause it feels odd in your arms

It would never be the same again
Can I ask, do you even miss me sometimes?
I want to be the one that without you'd be alone
Want to be the one that you will not let go
Go
Do you even miss me sometimes?
Go
Do you even miss me sometimes?

Do you even miss me sometimes?
Do you even miss me sometimes?
Do you even miss me sometimes?
