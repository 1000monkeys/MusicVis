{Intro}:
Yeah
Used to
{Verse 1}:
I used to feel like the world was against me
I used to feel like no one understands me
I used to write in the back of my class
I heard em talking but never attached
Focused on music but somehow I passed
I tend to leave before anything lasts
I hate a lot of things I used to do
I used to fight for no reason in school
Feeling bad now that I made fun of you
I'm sorry for that
Blame it on drama inside of my head
Blame it on anger inside of my chest
Too many words that I shouldn't have said
I'm tired of lying so I'll tell the truth
I would manipulate just to get through
Ah, just to get through
You called it a home, but it felt like a roof
Yeah
So I took it out on everyone I knew
How many bottles I went through
That I went through
{Chorus}:
All I know, all I know
I'm not in control
If you really knew the person that I am inside my soul
Then you might run away
In the mirror watch it break
I don't recognize all of the shit I did back in the day
Back in the day
{Bridge}:
Making fun of peoples' something that I used to do
Blame my father for my problems something that I used to do
Judging others by the way they look is what I used to do
Get addicted to some medications what I used to do
It's what I used to do
It's what I used to do
The world we're living in is burning this ain't new to you
It's what we used to do
It's what we used to do
Are you gonna do it different guess that is for you to choose
{Verse 2}:
Always got lost in the lows, never got stuck in the highs
So many people look up to me only because I been speaking my mind
I been looking for something to fill up a void
But I'm in a space that I cannot define
To all of the kids who are wondering why
You're looking for answers I cannot provide
One step then it's two to three
Run away from the human that I used to be
I'm in a new degree
But this is the truth they refuse to see
I'll stand alone on this mountain now
Coming up I'm just counting down
Got a problem just cutting out
All the friends that were not around, not around
{Chorus}:
All I know, all I know
I'm not in control
If you really knew the person that I am inside my soul
Then you might run away
In the mirror watch it break
I don't recognize all of the shit I did back in the day
Back in the day
Yeah
All I know, all I know
I'm not in control
If you really knew the person that I am inside my soul
Then you might run away
In the mirror watch it break
I don't recognize all of the shit I did back in the day
{Outro}:
Way too many thoughts for me to sleep at night
It took a couple years for me to come back out and see the light
Written hundreds of songs, most of em tossed aside
Take a peek inside my mind I offer you a piece of mine
The greatest gift that we've been given is the gift of time
And if you're growing in the passing days then you should not align
With what you used to do
The person that you used to be
I'm killing off the villain that I was this is his eulogy
