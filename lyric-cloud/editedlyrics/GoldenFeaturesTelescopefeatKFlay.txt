Walk around our town, wander 'round your place
Fuck it all, get faded
Then won't leave the house for days
Don't wanna rinse you off, won't forget the aftertaste
Living in the past, even though I know it's bad for me

So I've been looking out, keep-keeping track of you
I try to go, but all the roads, just circle back to you
Hold it in my mind, then I focus in, oh
Searching for a sign that you're not over this
Whoa-o-o-oa, I got a lock on you
I got a lock on you, I got a lock on you
Oh (oh)
Boy, I been caught on you
Hope you've been watching me
Like I've been watching you
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

When out a couple nights, but I did nothing fun
Slipped up a couple times, til' I had nothing on
Told myself a couple lies, but that's just how it's done, oh
Never showed this side, to find this side of love

So I've been looking out, keep-keeping track of you
I try to go, but all the roads, just circle back to you
Hold it in my mind, then I focus in, oh
Searching for a sign that you're not over this
Whoa-o-o-oa, I got a lock on you
I got a lock on you, I got a lock on you
Oh (oh)
Boy, I been caught on you
Hope you've been watching me
Like I've been watching you
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're in my telescope, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
