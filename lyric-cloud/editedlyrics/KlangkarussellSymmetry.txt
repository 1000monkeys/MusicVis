Hiding yourself away
Seeing the truth too late
It's no better anymore, no
And now line your head in form

The weather's too dark to see
Open up your eyes and talk to me
You and me we're living in symmetry
The only thing that matters let go of me
Together when the waves break
Together when the waves break

Everything leading to the quiet look in your eyes
Shadows all dance and fierse into me
We'll wake up and feel the light brushing over
As the sunrise clears the sky

The weather's too dark to see
Open up your eyes and hold on to me
You and me we're living in symmetry
I see you in simmered expecting me
Shining when the rest is too dark to see
The statues now gonna fall onto me
Cause you and me we're living in symmetry
The only thing that matters let go of me
Together when the waves break

(Hoooooo-ld, hoooooo-ld)
Hold on now, don’t chase to lie
Hold on now
Hold on now, don’t chase to lie
Hold on now

But when it’s too dark to see
Open up your eyes and hold on to me
You and me we’re living in symmetry
I see you, it’s a mirror looks back at me
Shining when the rest is too dark to see
Step yourself, come on hold on to me
‘Cause you and me we’re living in symmetry
The only thing that matters we’ll come to be
Together when the wave breaks
