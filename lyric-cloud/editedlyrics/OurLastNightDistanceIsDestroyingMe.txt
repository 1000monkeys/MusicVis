Are you okay?
I’ve been sitting here for days on end
I'm half awake and I'm thinking about the choices I've made

The distance is destroying me
Slowly eating me away
From the inside out like a parasite
You could be the only one
Who could save me now
You could be the only one
Who could save me now

Are you okay?
I’ve been sitting here for days on end
I'm half awake and I'm thinking about the choices I've made

The distance is destroying me
It's erasing my memory
And cutting deep into my bones like a chainsaw

Are you okay?
I’ve been sitting here for days on end
I'm half awake and I'm thinking about the choices I've made
The roads are closed and there's nowhere to go
So coast-to-coast, I'll drive until my eyes are closed

They can watch me bleed
Put salt in my wounds
Makes me weak
They can watch me bleed
Put salt in my wounds
Makes me weak

Are you okay?
I’ve been sitting here for days on end
I'm half awake and I'm thinking about the choices I've made
The roads are closed and there's nowhere to go
So coast-to-coast, I'll drive until my eyes are closed
