Are you really feeling better?
‘Cause I’m still high on you
Did he give you all the answers?
Does he need you like I do? (Like I do, like I do)

Now you won’t let me sleep
‘Cause your love is like a drug; all I need
Now I’ve fallen way too deep
But I’d rather be with you than be free

Maybe I just don’t remember
All your words and what they mean
But, baby, I just can’t forget you
I need you more than nicotine (nicotine, nicotine)

And you won’t let me sleep
‘Cause your love is like a drug; all I need
Now I’ve fallen way too deep
But I’d rather be with you than be free

(Nicotine)
And I’m just trying to dream ‘cause I don’t wanna feel
(Nicotine)
Till I wake up and find you and none of this is real
And you won’t let me sleep
'Cause your love is like a drug to me
Oh, let me sleep
Oh, all I need
Oh, way too deep
But I’d rather be with you, rather be with you

Oh, let me sleep (let me sleep)
‘Cause your love is like a drug; all I need (all I need)
And I’ve fallen way too deep (way too deep)
But I’d rather be with you than be free

Are you really feeling better?
‘Cause I’m still high on you
Are you really feeling better?
Does he need you like I do?
Does he need you like I do?
Does he need you like I do?
Does he need you like I do?
