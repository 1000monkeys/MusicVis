Yeah yeah, it's Vinnie Paz daddy
Fuckin' Jedi Mind Tricks
7L ES, King Syze, Outerspace
AOTP, what's the fuckin' deal
Yeah, we mobbin' on you muthafuckas
Ayo Warchild, take these muthafuckas to war cousin

It's the army cocksuckas' abandon ship
We spit sharp spot rushers that'll damage cliques
Rip hearts, squash fuckers, take a laugh at it
Bloody bath activists, feel the wrath of Crypt
Hungry ass hooligans that strike passionate
Basket case, used to not havin' shit
Maskin' tape, used to block passages
Until you're forced to stop breathin' on paralysis
I'm cancerous, cold-blooded battlest
Pass the fifth, Hen' makes me hazardous
You're average, no way to challenge this
Ravenous scorchin' fire acid-ness
Every move made precise I'ma strategist
Rock the world to the point where it's axis-less
No point to even learn what a atlas is
AOTP get it correct we smash shit

We underground where the roaches at
Corrosive, explosive, like Sosa's bat
I'm feelin' like one of baseball's greats in this shit
'Cause I make kids purpose second nature to spit
Talk shit and got smacked 'cause you shouldn't a spoke
Now when cats say you real dog they put it in quotes
I stay fly, aim high, like white put in our coat
We keep shit official like couples that wouldn't elope
We give the, press a scare like Jason Blair
Pharaohs treat you like an infidel, so fuckin' say your prayers
I snatch up crews, line 'em up like braided hair
They cornrows, basically you'd rather face the chair
I'ma, mastermind with a, axe to grind
Chiro, pratic lines, put ya, back in line
Opinionated muthafuckas who got some shit to say
They will voice it in the booth like it's election day

This is war cousin, we got shit on smash
7L, ES, on a run for the cash
Yo, this is war daddy, and I'm controllin' the fam
Our shit dope like coke without holdin' a gram
This is war cousin, we got shit on smash
7L ES on a run for the cash
Yo, this is war daddy, and I'm controllin' the fam
Our shit dope like coke without holdin' a gram

Some say I'm gifted, I write rhymes in less than 20-minutes
Impressive to critiques when I'm boss and apprentice
I see the future, within' extensive vision
I put this fuckin' track in the intensive division
King Syze, to all of y'all in case y'all didn't notice
I wrote this, tokin' roaches 'til my heads toasted
I'ma needle in the vein, spittin' the deadly dosage
Like T.O. I scream on head coaches
If the game plan ain't goin' my way, I threaten to leave
If we leave man the crowd goes to sedative sleep
Who's better than me, diamonds'll be testin' the teeth
My specialty feast, turn your rap to feminist speech
A pessimist beast, your glass is half empty
Put the, hanger on paper put your crowd in a frenzy
I could chop up my brain, pass it out to many
Only a chosen few would know how to use it dog, if any

The verb specialist, armed and dangerous
Ain't happy 'til I know you feelin' the pain from this
'Til you bleedin' in buckets, we all beef and ruckus
We are the fact of rap, you ain't gone see nothin'
No royalties, no promotion
I could talk that shit (don't front) I got you open
Illegal alien floatin' motion is uncontrollable
Sorta' like Christ, with the power to snatch souls from you
Ya whole spirit collapse, ya brain fried
Spittin' darts the Pharaohs come at you from eight sides
Esoteric and Vinnie got semis from Celph Titled
Space throw grenades King Syze got the rifles
Call Ap, when he react you fallin' back
Cheap pack and hop on the next flight to scrap
We made it happen now, backpackers go wild
'Cause space is the place to put a cramp in your style

This is war cousin, we got shit on smash
7L, ES, on a run for the cash
Yo, this is war daddy, and I'm controllin' the fam
Our shit dope like coke without holdin' a gram
This is war cousin, we got shit on smash
7L ES on a run for the cash
Yo, this is war daddy, and I'm controllin' the fam
Our shit dope like coke without holdin' a gram
