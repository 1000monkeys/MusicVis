Riding on my feathers I can lead you through the patterns we now follow
Lying on the floor, life between us lights a solid afterglow Afterglow
We gon' have a good time, waving by and by
We gon’ have a good time, waving by and by
Oh we found fun over there, we found fun over there
We gon' have a good time

I'll take you to the sun, all the way
The sun, all the way
I’ll take you to the sun, all the way
The sun, all the way
(Crazy, all night)

Riding on your feathers I can see us through the starry night
Our shadows
High above the floor, like two demons tryna' find a brighter soul

I'll take you to the sun, all the way
The sun, all the way
I'll take you to the sun, all the way
The sun, all the way
I'll take you to the sun
We gon' have a good time, waving by and by
We gon' have a good time, waving by and by
Oh we found fun over there
We found fun over there
We gon' have a good time
Good time, good time, good time, good time, good ti-

Riding on my feathers
We gon’ have a good time
Lying on the floor
Waving by and by
Riding on my feathers
We gon’ have a good time
Lying on the floor
Waving by and by

All the way, the sun
I'll take you to the sun
All the way, the sun

Yeah
