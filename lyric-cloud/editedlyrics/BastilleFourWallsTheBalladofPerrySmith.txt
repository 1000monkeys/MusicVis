These four walls to keep you
One floor to sleep upon and only
These four walls to keep you
These four walls contain you
Supposed to save you from yourself and
These four walls in
 
Holcomb
To keep you from the sun

And now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
Now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know

We could be born to anything
And now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible
And now you, and now you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you

These four walls will keep you
Until you face the rope
You've only these four walls before they
In cold blood, 
hang you up

And now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
Now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know

We could be born to anything
And now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible
And now you, and now you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you
(Now, you carry it with you)
(Carry it with you)
(Carry it with you)

There's no view from here
No view from here, no view from here
All you see's the sky
Clouds passing by, clouds passing by

We could be born to anything
And now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible
And now what, and now what?
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you

Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you
