Maybe you should leave this girl alone
But you wo-o-on't
But you do-o-on't
Now delete my number from your phone
But you wo-o-on't
You gotta go-o-o, oh
Line by line, gotta spell it right out (Yeah)

I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not caught in make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words no more

I'm just tellin' it like it is
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it
I'm just tellin' it like it is
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it
I'm just tellin' it like it is
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it
I'm just tellin' it like it is
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it
I'm just tellin' it like it is

Yeah, hold on wait a minute, let's make this right (Yeah)
You're the only one thing that I need in my life (I need)
And I ain't never met a girl like you before (You before)
I could tell you everything if you need to know (Need to know)
We was perfect before and I made mistakes (Yeah)
Told you I was all in, we can raise the stakes
Even though I'm a player, I ain't contemplate
Now you on a vacay, hotel, heartbreak (Ah, ah, 
oh

Champagne, all day, on me, oh yeah (
Ah

Got a room with a suite, so drunk, lose the key (
Oh

And I know we ain't over so, the ring, you can keep, ayy
We be right back tomorrow night (Tomorrow night), yeah
It's for life, you know we ride or die (Ride or die), yeah
Single for the night but you still mine
And I'ma chill with this shawty just to kill the time, you know
