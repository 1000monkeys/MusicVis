Yeah
That's right, keep yourself alive
Yeah! Ayy, yeah

I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Might you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Sold a million mirrors in a shop in alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
Tell you, just be satisfied, stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
That's right
That's right
Woo!

Well I loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need, feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I'd have to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, rode a million miles
Still be where I started, same as when I started

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
Take you on your time and honey, honey, you survive
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive (C'mon, c'mon)
All you people, keep yourself alive
(Thank you!)
