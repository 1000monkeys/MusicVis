Doomtree, time to let it be known
From the bottom of the bottle to the top of the throne
(Repeat 2x)
(Cecil Otter)
I hear ooh’s and ahh’s when I jump off my garage
People treat me like I’m dying for a cause
Cuz I believe in God, and Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny
I hang out with Lady Luck and I feed her when her 
beaver’s
 hungry
Don’t need your money, don’t need your company
Do need that filthy middle finger out my cup of tea
It takes one to bleed two to make the bleeding stop
I’d rather leave a trail of blood than let you make the bleeding stop
(Dessa)
This is synchronized sinking a single sided die, a 
tire farm
Sick of this sickness, I want a signal, a symbol, a sign
Sinners are seeking asylum, senators set to deny them
Sun at the center is dimming, spinning in silence
Synapses sing with science sitting inside us
Citizens’ sinuses ring with sirens whose singing is violence
It goes thanks T.S., but the world ends like this
Not a bang, not whimper, but a sibilant hiss
Doomtree, time to let it be known
From the bottom of the bottle to the top of the throne
(Repeat 2x)
(Mike Mictlan)
Put us up, megablast a classic burner
Idolize the insignia minnie millenniums idiot savant
Avant off guard, not scarred
Self-inflicted shots, stars, and locked bars
Drop arms, I got the face of Mars
Harness the strength, harvest my angst, chop spars
Let it out, say it loud, don’t bitch out
What time would be better than now?
Doomtree, watch your mouth
(P.O.S.)
Yo, I put the words to page, shed the weight of the day
But all work and no play makes jackknife a dull blade
So I stay sharp and cut the darkness with a chisel tip
A crew of kids who sizzle sets and fizzle out your best attempts
Doomtree, you know, we opened up, but left the spot blown
With call and response, you followed up but caught a dial tone
No nothing flashy, hypnosis, or backward masking shit
Simply raw shit y’all get lost in it
Dope? who you asking kid?
(Sims)
18 months ago before the snow
Before Sims was in the breeze
Distorted morbid kid pent up and bent on my disease
With a butterfly knife lining my gut
But Stef and Otter saved my life
Pulled me up and gave me stripes
Recovering loather now loving every moment
Telling opponents move over, we own it
I build from ashes when I write rhymes
And I’m proud to represent it, it’s my lifeline
Doomtree, time to let it be known
From the bottom of the bottle to the top of the throne
(Repeat 4x)
