Where do we go when we sleep
They say it's dangerous
Where do we go when we sleep
They say it's dangerous
Where do we go when we sleep
They say it's dangerous
To wake up
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
In my dreams we are free
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
They running from reality
They say it's dangerous
They say we're crazy, crazy
They say it's dangerous
They say we're running from reality
Reality, reality
Run, run, reality
Running from reality
Reality, reality
Run, run, reality
Running from reality
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
In my dreams we are free
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Where do we go when we sleep
They say it's dangerous
Where do we go when we sleep
They say it's dangerous
Where do we go when we sleep
They say it's dangerous
To wake up
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
In my dreams we are free
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
They running from reality
They say it's dangerous
They say we're crazy, crazy
They say it's dangerous
They say we're running from reality
