She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnetar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait
Hey, wait
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your Highness, I'm left back
Throw down your umbilical noose
So I can climb right back

Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
