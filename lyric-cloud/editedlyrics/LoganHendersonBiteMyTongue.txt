I've never been the social type
But I talk to myself every night
A million voices in my head
Scream out the things I should've said
(Bite my)

Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm fucking awkward
Yeah, yeah, but that's obvious
Yeah, yeah, and we'd get to talking
Yeah, yeah, but I would just bite my tongue

I could tell you so much
But we've both heard enough
Instead of making you blush
I bite my tongue
Like a devilish curse
That you put on my words
But I love that it hurts
Whenever you bite my tongue

Bite my tongue
(Bite my)

I've played out this scenario
So many times it's getting old
Just put my weary mouth to rest
So we can talk a little less
(Bite my)

Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm fucking awkward
Yeah, yeah, but that's obvious
Yeah, yeah, and we'd get to talking
Yeah, yeah, but I would just bite my tongue

I could tell you so much
But we've both heard enough
Instead of making you blush
I bite my tongue
Like a devilish curse
That you put on my words
But I love that it hurts
Whenever you bite my tongue

Bite my tongue
(Bite my)

Yeah, yeah (just bite my)
Yeah, yeah (bite my)
Yeah, yeah (just bite my)
Yeah, yeah

But I would just bite my tongue
I could tell you so much
But we've both heard enough
Instead of making you blush
I bite my tongue
Like a devilish curse
That you put on my words
But I love that it hurts
Whenever you bite my tongue

Bite my tongue
(Bite my)
