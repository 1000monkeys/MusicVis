It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
Steada treated
We get tricked
Steada kisses
We get kicked
It's the hard-knock life!
Don't if feel like the wind is always howlin?
Don't it seem like there's never any light??
Once a day, don't you wanna throw the towel in?
It's easier than puttin' up a fight
No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy
No one cares if you grow... or if you shrink
Empty belly life!
Rotten smelly life!
Full of sorrow life!
No tomorrow life!
Santa Claus we never see...
Santa Claus what's that? Who's he?
No one cares for you a smidge
When you're in an foster kid
It's the hard-knock life
(Make my bathroom shine
But don't touch my medicine cabinet!)
It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
Steada treated
We get tricked
Steada kisses
We get kicked
It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
No one cares for you a smidge
When you're in an foster kid
(It's the hard-knock life!)
(It's the hard-knock life!)
