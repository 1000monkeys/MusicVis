Stop, take it slowly darling
This time I'm feeling a change
Stop thinking too much about it
Love's going to heal us
Again and again
(Sway)
Just move with me darling
And I'm going to move with you too
Can't stop now you got me started
On top such a beautiful view

Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
(Sway)
(Sway)
Sway
(Sway)

Sway, just move with me darling
Sway, just move with me darling
Sway, just move with me darling
Sway, just move with me darling

Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Sway
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
(Sway)
(Sway)
(Sway)
Sway
(Sway)
Sway
