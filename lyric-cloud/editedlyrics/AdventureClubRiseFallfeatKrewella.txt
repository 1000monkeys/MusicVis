Go on, oh oh oh
Go on oh oh diving
Go on oh oh go higher (and through it all)
Go on, oh oh oh
Go on oh oh diving
Go on oh oh go higher (we rise and fall)
One breath in this moment
We'll stay 'til we're chosen (and through it all)
With our eyes wide open
We'll fight 'til we're broken (we rise and fall)
One breath in this moment
We'll stay 'til we're chosen
And through it all
With our eyes wide open
We'll fight 'til we're broken
(We rise and fall)
(We rise and fall)
(We rise and fall)
(We rise and fall)
(We rise and fall)
(We rise and fall)
(We rise and fall)
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
We'll fight 'til we're broken
We rise and fall
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
Go on, oh oh go higher (we rise and fall)
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
We rise and fall
We rise and fall
We rise and fall
We rise and fall
One breath in this moment
We rise and fall
We'll stay 'til we're chosen
And through it all
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
We'll fight 'til we're broken
We rise and fall
We rise and fall
We rise and fall
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
We'll fight 'til we're broken
We rise and fall
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide
With our eyes wide open
We rise and fall
Go on, oh oh go higher (we rise and fall)
With our eyes wide open
We'll fight 'til we're broken
We rise and fall
