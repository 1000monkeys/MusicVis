We can see the future
Standing on the backs of giants
The great ones that have come before us
Carrying torches
Showing us the way
On a long journey to get where we are
Sometimes it felt like we were losing our mind
Searching inside to find the sound
Started from nothing
But look at us now

Carrying torches
Showing us the way
On a long journey to get where we are
Sometimes it felt like we were losing our mind
Searching inside to find the sound
Started from nothing
But look at us now
