I don't know what's goin' on in the world today
It's like these girls can match purses and shoes
But can't match babies to daddies
But that's none of my business though

You's a broke boy, sleepin' on the couch
Livin' at your mama's house, tell me pimpin' what you 'bout?
No job but she always steppin' out
Zero in her bank account, hella niggas at your house

But that ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
That ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
But that ain't none of your business

Being an abomination is your occupation
She gave more head work than a trauma patient
You that boy claimin' that you stack money?
But be askin' your baby mama for her tax money
Got five kids, hollerin' 'bout she need a man
While her grandmama creepin' with the preacher man
How you claim to bounce out at any second?
But them skinny jeans came from the women's section
Clubbin' every night, but your kids with your granny
How you claim to be a dyke but my partner the daddy?
How your lace front crooked but your edges is nappy?
Watchin' Love and Hip-Hop only time you get heavy
Can't forget about you niggas, oh my God you so goofy
With your Ferragamo belts, Louis, Fendi, and Gucci
Waitin' at the bus stop, AC transit in Munich
You be slippin', boyfriend pimpin', 'cause you think she a cutie
Tell me why you don't practice safe sex?
And why your kids still rockin' Payless?
Your mama house where you drop your kids off
And you ratchet hoes still sharing lip gloss

But that ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
That ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
But that ain't none of your business

That EBT card just declined, huh?
Welfare but you ain't tryna wait in line, huh?
Instagram, you posting pictures of the same nigga
But that baby look like Trinidad James, nigga
The workout leggings kind of snug though
Why you wear those same leggings to the club though?
Your kitchen, it's a whole bunch of pots broken
And out the corner of my eyes I see cockroaches
When he came up, got a lot of more haters
Hope your pennies saved up, I got a lot of more paper
He done got you knocked up, playin' roles, captain save here
Whole year later, now he duckin' child support papers
How your hair and nails done but your rent overdue?
Why you wifing up thots when she lovin' the crew?
Takin' trips to the clinic 'cause your rubbers was loose
And baby them ain't Ugg boots, them the ugliest boots

But that ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
That ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
But that ain't none of your business

You's a broke boy, sleepin' on the couch
Livin' at your mama's house, tell me pimpin' what you 'bout?
No job but she always steppin' out
Zero in her bank account, hella niggas at your house

But that ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
That ain't none of my biz though
That ain't none of my business bitch
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
I don't two step, I just money dance
But that ain't none of your business
