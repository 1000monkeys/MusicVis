When you're coming closer
My pulse is boiling over
When you're coming closer
My time is ticking slower

Time is ticking slower
Time is ticking slower
Time is ticking
Time is ticking
Time is ticking slower

When my heart beats like a metronome
And I'm between the haze and the stroboscope
You better catch me here 'cause I am going home
When my heart beats like a metronome
Like, like a metronome
Like, like a metronome
Like, like a metronome

While it's getting darker
You got me in a wire
While it's getting darker
The nights becoming ours

Nights becoming ours
Nights becoming ours
Nights becoming
Nights becoming
Nights becoming ours

When my heart beats like a metronome
And I'm between the haze and the stroboscope
You better catch me here 'cause I am going home
When my heart beats like a metronome
Like, like a metronome
Like, like a metronome
Like, like a metronome

Metronome
When you're coming closer
When you're coming closer
Metronome

My heart beats like a metronome
And I'm between the haze and the stroboscope
You better catch me here 'cause I am going home
And my heart beats like a metronome
Like, like a metronome
(Like, like a metronome)
Like, like a metronome
(Like, like a metronome)
Like, like a metronome
Like, like a metronome
