We've reached the point where domination is the law
We're on the brink of global darkness
No life is worthy, but a pawn in our noble cause
Stomp out the feeble and the worthless

Fade
Deeper in the fray
Essence washed away
Crimson hands are stained
No more heroes now
No more heroes

A savage feast upon the weak at any cost
No sign of mercy for the masses
How about the dignity you had so long ago?
Is blood upon your hands as gracious?

Fade
Deeper in the fray
Essence washed away
Crimson hands are stained
No more heroes now (No more heroes)
No more heroes (No more heroes)
No more heroes
Fade
Deeper in the fray
Essence washed away
Crimson hands are stained
No more heroes now
We're all heroes now
No more heroes
