Better hear what I've got to say
Because you won't get it again
I am the truth

Hey you baby, you don't know
How bad it's gonna get
If you think shit sucks now
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Because it doesn't get better unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so just give up
It never gets better (no!) it gets worse
You're gonna die alone!
It gets worse

Now I'm no psychiatrist
I'm no doctor with no degrees
But it don't take no fucking scientist to figure out
That there is nothing in this world for me
Because it doesn't get better unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so listen the fuck up
It never gets better (no!) it gets worse
You're gonna die alone!
It gets worse

You're going down the road, the same one that we have
We cannot wait to watch life kick you in yo' ass
I shed a little tear for all of you out there
There's no way to escape, there's no way to escape
Welcome to hell 
Because it doesn't get better unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so just give up
It never gets better (no!) it gets worse
So long cruel world!
It gets worse
It gets worse
