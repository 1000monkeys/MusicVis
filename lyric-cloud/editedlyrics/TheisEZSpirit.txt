It's Prince Ea
Let me take you to the cradle of civilization, nigga
Listen, I spit rhymes with a sore throat;
Write bars in a language two people in this world know
I'm so hot that I burn coal;
Riding a triceratops rocking a Woolly mammoth fur coat
I'm here til the store close
But every two breaks I move crates with some man named Phillip Corso
He said, "We gotta move the workload to Bordeaux
Cause in four years they open the Lorentzian wormhole."
I said, "Who is they? You got any plans to show me?
And why the hell don't we tell the people that the planet's closing?"
He looked at me like I was joking; responded, "They'll never understand the omens
Because a person is smart, people are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it
Overwhelmed with arrogance and from the standpoint of the universe it's simply embarrassing
To think that we're the most technologically advanced people that there's ever been
It's a mistake that every great civilization has made before Armageddon hit
It evidences the fate of man
A predeterministic cycle; it's more than just a game of chance
Stop being a coward for once and just take my hand
I can show you the entire universe in a grain of sand
Layman to layman, the perfect teacher
I spent my whole life on a journey; a quest, a search for secrets
All I got in return was grief and a world of evil
I've seen the aliens described in the book of Ezekiel
I've seen religion bring out the worst in people;
The lives that permeate the pew to the church's steeple
What if I told you Mary, mother of Jesus, was impregnated secretly with a hypodermic needle?
And I have the evidence to prove this shit
What if I told you the peace sign was an inverted crucifix?
A symbol of Satanic worship from an iluminist
You're not familiar because history doesn't clue you in
I'm under the tutelage of a former mason
He said he used to piss on Bibles and practice self-mortification
The information he had was nothing short of sacred
He knew the bloodlines' leaders and top corporations
Who recognized the Devil as their Lord and Savior
And honored him with symbols placed all across the nation
Do you see it correlating?
Lucifer means "light bearer"; Lady Liberty is holding a torch of Satan
The coronations and the ghost hunts;
I know the truth." "So what motherfucker?" "Just hold on
You think getting called insane is so fun?
There is no New World Order, just the same old one."
You don't know much so I call you a fool
I know Bonobo Apes that are smarter than you
I'm on a boat near the coast of Nova Scotia
Conversing with some of the greatest poets over Folgers
I'm ticked off cause I keep getting pissed on and skipped over
They say I use too many euphemisms and misnomers
The fuck they know about sick poems?
I prepare my bars on Tarot cards; look at my pen floating
A chipped shoulder show a lack of respect
Knowing I'm the prototype and they pattern my steps
I write rhymes in the valley of the shadow of death
Then I'm the reason for the prickly things on the back of your neck
So you should commemorate and praise me
Cause I innovate like the way Hemingway illiterates speech
Let me demonstrate; art imitates life and life imitates me
Cause even God blessed my prose
He emitted a transmission of his image; I just fell in love
He looked just like me but was a genderless being
Creating no sound, which makes absolutely no sense
Cause he was loud like a megaphone
He told me rules are bent, some are set in stone
Some should be left alone
And once you find the meaning of life you die before you can tell a soul
I never let it go, it was too hard to swallow
Who is he to tell me what I can and can't know?
I'm not a coward; I sought out Sufi mystic strewed temples, the Dalai Lama
I'm so stupid trying to beat the system from the outside
The answer was in my Ajna Chakra all along
And it is as follows:
.home go or, car another into get, out get simply You
.life that's But
.wreck or gas of out run you Sometimes
.soul the, spirit the is seat driver's the in man the But
.brain the is engine The
.wheels, gears the comprises body The
.car a of that to comparable is life, See
.ideologies racist transcends idea The
?spirits our of manifestation physical arbitrary
The just is body the that learn humans you will When
.more much It's .face my not is me at look you when see you What
Sorry for the inconvenience in my rash words
I could only disclose one third -- backwards
He doesn't want his secret to slip
Cause as aforementioned in the conditions I would cease to exist
People will never understand Prince Ea, they'd rather hate him
I got scholars telling me, "You ain't smart
Half your rhymes don't make sense."
That's when I direct them to New Testament: Luke 8:10
Science becomes religion when you're closed off
By the very theories that you've been ingrained in
But the egos of you scientists; to say definitively that metaphysics is illegitimate
When we both know that humans can only detect ten percent out of everything that exists
You pretentious quacks need to get your ass kicked
Since when does absence of evidence equate to evidence of absence?
Quit telling lies. I shift paradigms with just about every line
Keep sleeping on me til I give you that feeling at night where it seems like you paralyzed
I just can't put the pencil down. I'm in the back of a coffee shop
Solving the equation that Einstein himself died trying to figure out
Perfect to a few, but to most just a meaningless ball of confusion
These are the bars from Sumer
