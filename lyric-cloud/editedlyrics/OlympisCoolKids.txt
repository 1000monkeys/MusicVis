Ancient astronauts downtown at the arcade
Running high scores on asteroids
Are the cool kids amazed
Whispering in the ear
Little fat for you to chew
There’s a little bit of we in each of you
Be a hell of a start but straight from the heart
Spinning tales like tires on a getaway car
I ride the brakes you pump the gas
God only knows but we all can ask
So we ask and we live and we love
We ask we live and we love
Angels and demons
They all play the same part
Just smoke screens snake oil
A little bomb for the house
It’s a charming offensive
On a well-worn arc
A patina perfected
An Olympian art
From Olympus to Babylon
To the city of light
Been drowned out been dammed up
Been blitzed by night
We beg for answers
We pray for proof
We fight for fame
And we bleed for the truth
We all fight and we bleed and we beg and pray
We bleed we beg and we pray
Twentieth century still got a grip on me
I can’t keep up with the wild mercury
A thousand fears on the quickening pace
We all got story scrawled lines in our faces
In the opuses we sing
And the hopefulness it bring
Ringing out from the highest mountains
And the soldier has the kings
Calling the shots
Connecting the dots
The canvases might change
But blood is the constant
Who fought first
Brought on the curse
Was it just a bang
Was it all rehearsed
God only knows where it goes from here
Where do we go from here
Where we come to
If we come to
When we come to
If we come to
Where we come to
Where do we go from here
