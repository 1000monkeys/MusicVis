There's no time for redemption
Those flags you wave, will they hold up?
Don't cry for your vengeance
It's right there to take, oh, if you want it
The world is watching

Here's your judgment, here's your reckoning
Write your story down into history
Pride and country, you could have everything
So bring home the glory alive

Go and rise for your nation
There's so much at stake, will you show up?
Oh it's about damn time for a little salvation
Those flags you wave, represent them
The world is watching

Here's your judgment, here's your reckoning
Write your story down, down into history
Pride and country, you could have everything
So bring home the glory alive

Here's your judgment
Here's your reckoning
So go and bring home the glory alive

Here's your judgment (Your judgment)
Here's your reckoning (Your)
Write your story down, down into history
Pride and country (Ooh)
You could have everything (Have everything)
So bring home the glory alive
