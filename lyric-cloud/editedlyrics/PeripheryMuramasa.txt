Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall
But in the distance we can see shining clear
Our demise to be; we're not listening to ourselves
You ask these questions in subconsciousness, but still
We choose to deny the flood surrounding nations
Wake up! The water is rising now!
We are the universe inside of you waiting patiently
All the world by a thread?
Distance the lies that are sold
They will not justify the pain
They will not live to see the day
