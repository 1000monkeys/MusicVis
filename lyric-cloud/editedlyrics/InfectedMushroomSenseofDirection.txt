So blind I cannot see
You've found your way to me
So blind I cannot see
You've found your way to me

You always give me sense of direction
You always give me sense of direction
You always give me sense of direction

So blind I cannot see
You've found your way to me
So blind I cannot see
You've found your way to me

You always give me sense of direction
You always give me sense of direction
You always give me sense of direction
