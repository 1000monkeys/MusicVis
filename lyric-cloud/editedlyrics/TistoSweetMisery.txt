Fall into you
Do you really want to know?
Tell me, tell me
Can you feel me lettin go? slowly
I'm scared to fall into you
I want to
Feel you
Touch you
Know you
I want to, so I let you set me free
Into sweet misery
There's a hunger do you know
Feed me, feed me
It's gettin harder not to show
Free me
I'm scared to fall into you
I want to
Feel you
Touch you
Know you
I want to, so I let you set me free
Into sweet misery
*chantin*
Sweet misery
I want to
Feel you
Touch you
Know you
I want to, so I let you set me free into Sweet misery
I want to
Feel you
Touch you
Know you
I want to, so I let you set me free
Sweet misery
