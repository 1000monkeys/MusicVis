No control
How wonderful
How horrible
You see me guessing
Don't you know?
Thoughts explode
Unconjurable
Unstoppable
You see me lacking
Won't you grow?
Won't you

Believe
That even now you'll take hold
That even now you'll beat it
Don't you know?

Broke in two
How wonderful
How vulnerable
You see me laughing
Don't you know?
Don't you

Believe
That even now you'll take hold
That even now you'll beat it
Don't you know?
Breathe in
And even now you'll take hold
And lead it on till the end
Don't you know?

And all that is freedom
And all that enslaves
I'll never believe again
And all that is weakness
And all that is fake
Will never deceive again

Breathe in
And even now you'll take hold
And even now you'll beat it
Don't you know?
Believe
And even now you'll take hold
And even now you'll beat it
Don't you know?
