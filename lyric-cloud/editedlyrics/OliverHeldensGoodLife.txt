Got a ticket to a better day
And the gold don't even shine
But you and me would have to run away
Still you're gonna feel alive
I can show you an easy way
Just take my hand tonight
When you feel like you're standing still
It's gonna catch you by surprise

We fail, we win, then start again
Keep on moving
We fail, we win, then start again
Keep on moving

This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life

Always searching for an open door
When you're there you realise
Look no further cause you got the keys
Gonna open up your eyes
Just imagine an easy way
And run with me tonight
I know you feel like you're standing still
It's gonna catch you by surprise

We fail, we win, then start again
Keep on moving
We fail, we win, then start again
Keep on moving

This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life

This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
This is the good life
