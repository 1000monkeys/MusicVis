Pull me up off of the pavement
Dilated eyes in the blue sunrise, no!
That can't be me — I must be mistaken
I've been an angel my whole life
How well do you know yourself?
How clear without the mirror of someone else
'Cause sometimes my shadow gets the best of me
A black black so pitch that I cannot breathe
And I cannot speak, and I cannot hide
But I guess you can't be free of what you keep inside, well--
How well do you know your limits?
The deeper the dream the longer you’re in it

Maybe if I had a little more money
Maybe if I had a little more sex
Maybe with a little more peace and quiet
Maybe I could make a little more sense of it

All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want

The river of cars keeps flowing
All I can see is what’s right in front of me
This isn’t where I thought I was going
This isn’t who I thought I would be
Met a man in the cab today
Moved here from across the ocean someplace
Where his family waits, but he’s all alone
To drive a cab all day and send it all back home
I would have felt bad but he flashed his eyes
And I could hear the joy in his voice. It was like
There was nowhere in the world that he’d rather be
Than here, in a cab, driving me

Maybe if I went out less on the weekend
Maybe if I just didn't exist
Maybe if I was straight, maybe if I was vegan
Maybe if I still had you to kiss

All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want

I am my own sanctuary
I am my own hero
I am my own teacher
I am my own best friend
I am my own Friday night
I am my own love of my life
I am my own way out
I am my own sanctuary
I am my own sanctuary

Maybe if I had a little more money
Maybe if I had a little more sex
Maybe with a little more peace and quiet
Maybe I could make a little more sense of it

All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
All that I want
A little more sense of it
All that I want
