Wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go boom boom and your guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go boom boom and your guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go boom boom and your guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go boom boom and your guns go... blaow

My firepower keep me-
Motherfucker what
Then I make my trigger finger-
And I wipe motherfuckers-

I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go boom boom and your guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go boom boom and your guns go... blow

I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go-
I got the wildstyle, always been a foul child
My guns go-

My firepower keep me-
Huh
Motherfucker what
And I wipe motherfuckers-
