I guess I am stuck in this in-between
It's gone 24 hours but I just can't sleep
It's not that easy anymore
It's not that easy
So take me back take me take me take me back again
Nothing's appealing
So take me back take me take me take me back again

So you can call me disaster
It's so nice to meet you
But I think I'll say goodbye once, maybe twice
This is the last time
Get up! Get up!
Get yourself out of my bed
She said that I was nothing but a hopeless wreck
And the truth hurts

And everything's so difficult, my head is still unclear
The silence breaks me so damn hard
That it's deafening my tears
My words just seem to echo louder with each breath
The more I search the less I gain
Always told it's just a test

So you can call me disaster
It's so nice to meet you
But I think I'll say goodbye once, maybe twice
This is the last time
Get up! Get up!
Get yourself out of my bed
She said that I was nothing but a hopeless wreck
And the truth hurts, the truth hurts

Flashback to the cold December
Half-baked smiles as I remember
I came through as I wanted truth
Flash-forward into the summer
All alone my heart surrendered
I learnt soon that I'd found my truth

Call me disaster
It's so nice to meet you
But I think I'll say goodbye one last time
Get up! Get up!
Get yourself out of my bed
She said that I was nothing but a hopeless wreck
And the truth hurts
(This is the last time)
Get up! Get up!
Get yourself out of my bed
She said that I was nothing but a hopeless wreck
And the truth hurts, the truth hurts
