Remember when our hearts would beat as one
We used to have a love that felt so strong
Remember lying in the summer sun
Just take me back where we belong

I'm longing for your touch that felt so right
I know that we can go for real this time
Just tell me that you are the only one
And take me back where we belong

I need you by my side, you make me come alive
Don't give up, I'm holding on
Don't leave me here this way, I just need you to stay
So take me back where we belong

I'm dreaming of the days when we were young
We could've had it all; so what went wrong?
I'm dreaming of the time that feels long gone
Just take me back where we belong

I'm longing for your touch that felt so right
I know that we can go for real this time
Just tell me that you are the only one
So take me back where we belong

I need you by my side, you make me come alive
Don't give up, I'm holding on
Don't leave me here this way, I just need you to stay
So take me back where we belong
