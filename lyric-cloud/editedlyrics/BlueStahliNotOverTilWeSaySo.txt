(Go!)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)

On endless floors and corridors
Weak but not broken
And through the rust it's hunting us
The last breath is spoken

You'll never stop me, stop me
I'll bring an army with me
It's never over, over
And it's not over 'til we say so

(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)

It keeps us here and knows our fear
Our kindred divider
So stand up to the past we knew
We'll scream through the wires

You'll never stop me, stop me
I'll bring an army with me
It's never over, over
And it's not over 'til we say so

You'll never stop me, stop me
I'll bring an army with me
It's never over, over
And it's not over 'til we say so
You'll never stop me, stop me (ah-ah)
I'll bring an army with me (ah-ah)
It's never over, over (ah-ah-ah)
And it's not over 'til we say so
