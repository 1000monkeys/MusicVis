Yah!

Hit me or get lost
Chin check your jaw what’s up?
'Coz I ain’t got time for you liars, no love
I'm about to expose
You schemers that's been frontin'
You're giving me that awkward look
When I’m giving my 100%?
I'll send you in one shot
Cut you off before you even speak
Slap you
Leave you with a handprint then
Finish you with an uppercut
What's with Mr. Kim gettin' more commas in his books
And the montage of fake deals that never happened
Let me cut these bosses off, throw a hot soup at them
Coz' I'mma do me, you keep doing you
You petty ass fools
You are what you eat
Y'all producers and writers front and talk too much
In secrecy, can't keep up with your own words
See? Y'all owe me a big one
It's more reason's not to trust you (yah!)
So if y'all want beef then come meet me at the grill
Coz I will tug out your intestines, and put them in a big bowl
Ask your friends to take out the fire after I cook and flip the game

Buck buck buck all you liars
Duck duck that goo better duck
Drop top coupe tattoos
Get lost if y'all ain't feeling me
Too slow you're a goo
Keep outta my sight
Y'all are scared
Dot dot
Rrrah Dot Rrrah put dots on your head
Buck buck buck all you liars
Duck duck that goo better duck
Drop top coupe tattoos
Get lost if y'all ain't feeling me
Too slow you're a goo
Keep outta my sight
Y'all are scared
Dot dot
Rrrah Dot Rrrah put dots on your head

You’re fraudulent, inject that collagen
From your heart to your cartilage
Only around for a season
You hang like ornaments
I'm tearing down all of it
Fake rappers confident
Until I'm ripping ya’ll open condiments
Straight totally finish them all
Your girl knows what's up I do it properly
Taking heads by the dozen
This neighborhood barber been buzzing
U.S to London, Taipei to Dublin
I run it the champagne be bubbling (whip, whip)
Whip that bitch ass every day
Son you with my Harry Kane aye
Have a taste salivate, pat a cake
Clap clap clap that tatted face aye

Boy looking like rapper let your chain hang
Dollar dollar bill rubber band man
Fronting hard body with your gang gang
The moment you’re alone get the backhand (what)
I ain't got I ain't got time for you liars
Low on funds and never showing love
You’re a straight dud
Boy don't be touching my dutch
Get out my truck I flips that clutch

Buck buck buck all you liars
Duck duck that goo better duck
Drop top coupe tattoos
Get lost if y'all ain't feeling me
Too slow you're a goo (liars)
Keep outta my sight (liars)
Y'all are scared (liars)
Dot dot
Rrrah Dot Rrrah put dots on your head
Buck buck buck all you liars
Duck duck that goo better duck
Drop top coupe tattoos
Get lost if y'all ain't feeling me
Too slow you're a goo
Keep outta my sight
Y'all are scared
Dot dot
Rrrah Dot Rrrah put dots on your head

I ain’t got time for you liars
You scared little chump
You're scared, a liar
I ain’t got time for you liars
You scared little chump
You're scared, a liar
