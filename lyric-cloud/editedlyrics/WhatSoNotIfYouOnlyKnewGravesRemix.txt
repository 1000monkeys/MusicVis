If I ever knew
You would only hurt me
Maybe I deserve it
Whispers turn to truth
If I only knew, knew, baby

Just trying to get a hold on you
Just trying to get a find on you
Just trying to get a hold on
Nothing left to lose
If I only knew

You could tell the truth
If I only knew

Nothing means relation
No more celebration
If I ever knew
Your manipulation
God is the creation

If you never knew
If I only knew
Nothing left to lose
If I only knew

You could tell the truth
If I only knew

If I only knew
If I only knew
