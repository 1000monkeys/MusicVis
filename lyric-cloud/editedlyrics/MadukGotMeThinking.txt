Yeah let me rise
Say, I'll tell you I'm sorry
And don't think I'm wise
Because of you
Because you
You got me thinking
Ooh nah nah
Don't make me listen
Ooh nah nah
Give me permission
Ooh nah nah
Get in the system with me
Ooh nah nah
This is a prison
Check yourself, I'm all right
You got me thinking
Did you see the warning lights?
Ooh you got me thinking
You messed up, I was right
Got me thinking
Doctor, doctor, not so bright
(Doctor, doctor, not so bright)
Every single thing you wanted
Now I got it
Everything we built together
Now I want it
Running a-away ain't gonna solve it
You weren't prepared to begin or to pause it
Something that would make you mad, oh I love it
Go on, just tell me I'm bad, oh, you called it
Someone you could never trust you're so on it
Now I'm done with kissing up, so you're walking
(Got me thinking)
Check yourself, I'm all right
You got me thinking
Did you see the warning lights?
Ooh you got me thinking
You messed up, I was right
Got me thinking
Doctor, doctor, not so bright
(Doctor, doctor, not so bright)
Every single thing you wanted
Now I got it
Everything we built together
Now I want it
Running a-away ain't gonna solve it
You weren't prepared to begin or to pause it
Something that would make you mad, oh I love it
Go on, just tell me I'm bad, oh, you called it
Someone you could never trust you're so on it
Now I'm done with kissing up, so you're walking
There are people in there
And don't think I'm letting them burn
The facility is our responsibility
And don't it hurt you
To up and leave
