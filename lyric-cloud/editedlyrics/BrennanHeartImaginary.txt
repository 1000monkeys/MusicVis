Sleep to dream tonight
Fill the empty spaces that shadows left behind
You and I
Will create a new world
Deep within our minds
Though reality sometimes may seem
Imaginary
Happines is here within our reach
No though it can´t be seen
The world created in our dreams
Imaginary
I still feel all the same release
Imaginary
Imaginary
OhOoh
Imaginary
Imaginary, yeah
Imaginary
Galaxies of lights
Surround and break down all the fears that shadows left behind
Escape tonight
To a clear blue sky, just close your eyes and wave goodbye
Though reality sometimes may seem
Imaginary
Happiness is here within the reach
And though it can´t be
Seen the world created in my dreams
Imaginary
I still feel all the same release
Imaginary
Imaginary
OhOoh
Imaginary
Imaginary, yeah
Imaginary
