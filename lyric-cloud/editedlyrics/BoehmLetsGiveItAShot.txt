Every question that you lay across the table
All the answers standing right in front of me
Every inch of me is willing if you're able
So tell me what else do you need

Let's give it a shot
A shot in the dark, ready to fall
Just give me your heart
'Cause I want it all, give me your heart

You know everyday, is a holiday
When you come my way, oh-oh
We can celebrate even if it rains, this is our parade, oh-oh

Let's give it a shot
Let's give it a shot
Let's give it a shot
(Give me your heart, give me your heart, oh)
(Give me your heart, give me your heart, oh)
Let's give it a shot
A shot in the dark, ready to fall

Every second that we spend together dreaming
We get closer to the spaces we should be
Lost in the moment
Taking off there ain't no ceiling
So tell me what's it gonna be

Let's give it a shot
A shot in the dark
Ready to fall
Just give me your heart
'Cause I want it all, give me your heart

You know everyday, is a holiday
When you come my way, oh-oh
We can celebrate even if it rains, this is our parade, oh-oh
Let's give it a shot
A shot in the dark, ready to fall
Just give me your heart
'Cause I want it all, give me your heart

Let's give it a shot
Let's give it a shot
A shot in the dark, ready to fall
Just give me your heart
'Cause I want it all, give me your heart

(Give me your heart, give me your heart, oh)
(Give me your heart, give me your heart, oh)
(Give me your heart, give me your heart, oh)
(Give me your heart, give me your heart, oh)
