Yo
Glitter Moneyyy leaves these dudes dreaming
We always scheming
They be weeping while we do the healing
Look at the flick of my hair
Boom, knocked the whole building block
I'm that's so motherfucking raven
Talk to the town on lock
We soaring other these muthafuckas lookin up our skirts
Yall snoring while we exploring 20 says to subvert
Yo it must hurt
Genie ain't in her bottle no more
Trashleys on the dance floor with the next world war. And that's for sure

I’m a good witch and a bad bitch
See a fuckboi scheming I will snitch
Taking off on my broomstick
Got Toil and Trouble & lipstick
We claim the atmosphere
No shame & we won’t share
Femme, fierce we flying
Pixie dust, & stupefying
You look at us and start wishing
We your fantasy & your vision
Pussy your only ambition
We put dicks in remission//
 Don’t be lying y’all be dreaming
G money's everything you need in
 Bow down get to kneeling
 and get the Fuck up out your feelings

You been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout


Where is your energy? I'm battling enemies /
Shattering frequencies, hearing the God in me /
Moving in harmony, waiting for my soul to align /
Bask in the shine of the ley / line /
Looking for that loophole in the sky /
Bending mystic arts, to reveal my truth / I
Enter the kumite, conquer Olympus until they fuck / with / me /
Channeling chakra through to my finger tips with a Gen / tle / fist /
Heavenly spin, spinning the word with the verse /
Poetry piercing your soul / glow /
Knowing the ends of the u / ni / verse /
Odd I'm seeing (Odysseying) through the stars / now /
Hearses come in magic
Spiral through the static
Snapping a kingdom in half
/ That's /
Triple seven voodoo
Spitting that Champloo
Dynasties crumble in two
/ I /
Overdose on poems
Dreaming in overtones
Orbit my Zen once again
/ See /
Vagabond Maurice is just an anagram for excellence /

You been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout

Melatonin totin motherfucker mute your own messiah how you sleep on me
Medicated cause you need the dreams
You ain't seein me so frequently
Open your eyes, at least the three spot
I'll make the knock of the beast stop
I'll nosferstu your roster
All other gods are imposters
You should play me on your alarm
Sunrise on a State Farm
And you all a buncha livestock
Feed trough where you buy stock
You just waitin on a pine box
Me I'm bussin with the pine-sol
Hustle muscle on my grind all
Times y'all blind no eyeballs
Bet you see me in your nightmares tho
I been your untapped potential
A glance in the mirror the vices that tempt you
A life you attempt to touch Saturday night
While you playin it safe in your everyday life
You could chase a feeling, never find a calling
You find me offensive, I find you appalling
How is dreaming galling? We evolving into unfeeling, feeble close-minded people clotheslining all our dirty laundry
Without no trying for no progression
I am so tired of the broke stressin
No possessions but a love for all things
Sun rising it is almost dawning
Dreamin bout me, see you in the morning

You been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
