I've been dining on coffee and cigarettes
Waiting all day for you to phone
And the night will come with new regrets
But I can't stand to be alone

Flying forever, it's so hard to set things free
Flying forever, I just want you to be with me
Flying forever, I'm too far away to see
Flying forever, I wait while you fly free

Finding someone new to ease this pain
But it's not you, it's not the same
They make me feel so very unknown
But I can't stand to be alone

Flying forever, it's so hard to set things free
Flying forever, I just want you to be with me
Flying forever, I'm too far away to see
Flying forever, I wait while you fly free

It's summer now, I close my eyes
And I feel the sun on my face
It reminds me of the times we had
And of your warm embrace
It's summer now, I close my eyes
And I feel the sun on my face
It reminds me of the times we had
And of your warm embrace
It's summer now, I close my eyes
And I feel the sun on my face
It reminds me of the times we had
And of your warm embrace

Flying forever, it's so hard to set things free
Flying forever, I just want you to be with me
Flying forever, I'm too far away to see
Flying forever, I wait while you fly free
Flying forever, it's so hard to set things free
Flying forever, I just want you to be with me
Flying forever, I'm too far away to see
Flying forever, I wait while you fly free

Pushing and pulling within my own thoughts
I wish you would give us another shot
Now that I know it's done forever
There's a hole in me where you used to be
