Turned 5 am, no sleep again
So tired, mind wide open
I'm on the same journey East, life on repeat
Frustrated and broken
And we all just need a little something to hold on to
Another day at the puppet show
Now I'm heading back to you

When I'm caught in the strings, in the strings
And I fall under the weight of everything
And then I'm caught, and then I'm caught
In the slipstream of your smile
And it makes it all, makes it all worthwhile

Misplaced and lost, walking through lonely avenues
Got nothing left, I draw a breath, no more bad news
'Cause we all just need a little something to hold on to
If the world won't meet me half way then I know you do

When I'm caught in the strings, in the strings
And I fall under the weight of everything
And then I'm caught, and then I'm caught
In the slipstream of your smile
And it makes it all, it makes it all worthwhile
