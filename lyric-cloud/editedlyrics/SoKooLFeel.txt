Anything for a dollar bill, yeah, ah
Anything for a dollar bill, yeah
Dollar bill, ooh

They put dirt all in my goddamn life, I took my bath
Popped 'bout fifteen guns in twenty-two days, I did my math
Bitch, you ain't playin' with no lame, I ain't playin' no games, I want my bag (Uh-huh)
Spent like fifteen racks in like twenty-two days, I did, my bad (Feel like, "Goddamn")
It's so many dollar bills, yeah (Goddamn)
Shawty wanna ride my hill, ooh (Like, "Goddamn")
I just popped my pills, yeah (Feel like, "Goddamn")
You don't know how I feel, oh, oh (I feel like, "Goddamn"), oh

Like my racks like my truck, yeah, I lift it up
Championship ring on my knuckle cost me fifteen bucks
Copped me a pint, thirteen hundred, ran through with fifteen cups, ooh
Fourteen days, you was too weak, nigga ain't beat me up
Thumbin' like long live Bankroll, dawg, you was too street
I done popped my pill on my own, you was too geeked
Bougie nigga, I was so broke, they ain't know 'bout me (Bougie)
So, bougie nigga, I done got money, I barely speak (Bougie)
Sets like, "Who is this nigga, ice on like he Gretsky?" (Skooly)
Like, "Who is this nigga bangin' that six like Grape Street?" (Long live Nipsey)
Suicide, haters die every day
Clueless vibe, want me a girl like Ella Mai, yeah

They put dirt all in my goddamn life, I took my bath (Want me a girl like Ella Mai)
Popped 'bout fifteen guns in twenty-two days, I did my math
Bitch, you ain't playin' with no lame, I ain't playin' no games, I want my bag (Uh-huh)
Spent like fifteen racks in like twenty-two days, I did, my bad (Feel like, "Goddamn")
It's so many dollar bills, yeah (Goddamn)
Shawty wanna ride my hill, ooh (Like, "Goddamn")
I just popped my pills, yeah (Feel like, "Goddamn")
You don't know how I feel, oh, oh (I feel like, "Goddamn"), oh

I'm mad rich, remember I was broke, they used to laugh, ayy
Geeked on Adderalls, but I still had an E in math, ayy
We was all stuck, that's why they call that shit a trap
I got high as hell and I seen hate all in the air
Saint Laurent mannequin, I'm drippin', you panickin'
I'm close to my enemies, they don't see the inner me
On that same block, I treat it like Mutombo, nigga
Can't give that nigga five if I handed him a bunch of nickels
I'm sippin' codeine, I ain't really into drinkin' liquor
Ain't with the internet beef, real gangster, I got real issues
Million from my deal, remember times that I couldn't buy a pickle
Fuck them haters, they grab shovels and

They put dirt all in my goddamn life, I took my bath
Popped 'bout fifteen guns in twenty-two days, I did my math
Bitch, you ain't playin' with no lame, I ain't playin' no games, I want my bag (Uh-huh)
Spent like fifteen racks in like twenty-two days, I did, my bad (Feel like, "Goddamn")
It's so many dollar bills, yeah (Goddamn)
Shawty wanna ride my hill, ooh (Like, "Goddamn")
