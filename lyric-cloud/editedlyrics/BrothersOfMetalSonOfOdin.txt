(Ha-ha-ha! Ragnarök!)
I am the son of Odin, I bring Lightning from the sky
With my hammer Mjölnir, I was born to die
Brother of deception leaves me with no choice
I want to scream my heart out, but I have lost my voice
Thursday bears my name
Shameless I’m still the same
All-Father of wind and rain
Thunder I am your bane
I believe in honor and my fist's made of steel (is made of steel)
Loki is my brother, he has no sex-appeal
Fire, blood and magic leaves me with a thirst
I want to ride to battle but I have lost my horse
Thursday bears my name
Shameless I’m still the same
All-Father of wind and rain
Thunder I am your bane
Our warriors, we come riding from beyond
Oh, the bravest few, we look for you, who are worthy of hearing our song
We will carry every broken heart and bone
Fall asleep and by Odin be reborn
(Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin, Odin)
And by Odin be reborn
Thursday bears my name
Shameless I’m still the same
All-Father of wind and rain
Thunder I am your bane
