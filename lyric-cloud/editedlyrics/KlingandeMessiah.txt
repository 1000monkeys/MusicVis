Ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh good lord, you got me sold to champagne dreams tonight
You know I feel it, and I want it and I need it, eh-eh
I said, oh good lord, you got me solely wet, can we collide?
Shout when you feel it, when you want it, when you need it, eh

See, I've been looking for a piece of heaven
So come on, preach your sugar, show the way

I said, baby take me higher, higher
Would you be my messiah? Ooh-ooh
Messiah, ooh-ooh
I said, baby take me higher, higher
Would you be my messiah? Ooh-ooh
Messiah, ooh-ooh

(Would you be my messiah?)
Be my messiah, ooh-ooh
Messiah, ooh-ooh
(Ooh) Be my messiah

Oh my god, you shake my soul, I need your holy wine
I wanna  it, wanna feel it, wanna need it, eh-eh
I'm saying, oh my god, you shake my soul, your smoke is so divine
I really feel it, really want it, really need it, eh

See, I've been looking for that piece of heaven
So come on, preach your sugar, show the way, yeah

I said, baby take me higher, higher
Would you be my messiah? Ooh-ooh
Messiah, ooh-ooh
I said, baby take me higher, higher
Would you be my messiah? Ooh-ooh
Messiah, ooh

Messiah, messiah
I said, baby take me higher, higher
Would you be my messiah? Ooh-ooh
Messiah, ooh-ooh
Messiah, messiah (Be my messiah, ooh)
Be my messiah (Ooh)
