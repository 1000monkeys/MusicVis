I never asked you when we settled in
'Cause we were happy then
In the room
But I need to know if I'm your everything
Or if I'm wearing thin
Too soon
Can I hear it from you?

I know that this is still love
That's why I'm hiding from you
Nothing I do is enough
You see, you're faking it through
I can't escape your love
I can't escape your love

I'm on the underside of everything
But I can't keep it in
For you
You've got the upper hand on anything
I'm tired of caving in on cue
So sick of telling you

I know that this is still love
That's why I'm hiding from you
Nothing I do is enough
You see, I'm faking it through
I can't escape your love
I can't escape your love

And why won't you give over
When I told you I'll never be enough
And I know if it's over
I'll get over this still love
Why won't you give over
When I told you I'll never be enough
And I know if it's over
I'll get over this still love

I know that this is still love
That's why I'm hiding from you
Nothing I do is enough
You see, I'm faking it through
I can't escape your love
I can't escape your love
I know that this is still love
That's why I'm hiding from you
Nothing I do is enough
You see, I'm faking it through
I can't escape your love
I can't escape your love
