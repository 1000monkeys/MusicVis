Until the philosophy, which holds one race superior
And another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited and abandoned

And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

Everywhere is war
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war
It's a war

And until there's no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
It's on
And until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
We say war

And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
And war down south
Everywhere is-
Oh, everywhere is war

(It's war!)
It's a war
(It's war!)
Oh, everywhere is war
(It's war!)
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
Everywhere is war!

Everywhere is war!
