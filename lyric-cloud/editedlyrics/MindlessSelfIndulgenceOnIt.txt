Wait
I masturbate
Let another motherfucker come and share my fate
And pray
Catastrophe
I’ma kill a muthafucka with a fax machine
And break
It down
For y’all
To seeeeeeeee
‘Cause I’m on it
Yes indeed
On it
Watch me bleed
On it
Rest in peace
On it
Hey hey hey
You are so good so far
Better than this
Better than that
Better watch out when you get me going going going
Fake
I’m not awake
It ain't my fault you can’t relate
Doubt
Corporate accounts
I’ma hurt somebody with my 24 ounce
And break
It down
For y’all
To seeeeeeeee
‘Cause I’m on it
Yes indeed
On it
Watch me bleed
On it
Rest in peace
On it
Hey hey hey
You are so good so far
I’m gonna be the one with my face in a magazine
I’m gonna be the one I have to face
Better than this
Better than that
Better watch out when you get me going
In the morning I have come
Rip the walls, rip the bass
In the morning I’m gone
Putting you in your place
