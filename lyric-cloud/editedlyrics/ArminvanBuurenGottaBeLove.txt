I was walking wounded
Through frozen lonely nights
You tape my heart together
You kiss the pain goodbye

It's gotta be love, be love, be love
It's gotta be love, be love, be love

It's gotta be love and I hear you calling me
It's gotta be love, here I am again, I'm ready
It's gotta be love

It's gotta be love, be love, be love
It's gotta be love, be love, be love

Join me through the night
I catch your fall and push all fears aside

It's gotta be love, be love, be love
It's gotta be love, be love, be love

It's gotta be love and I hear you calling me I hear you call
It's gotta be love, here I am again, I'm ready

It's gotta be love, It's gotta be love, It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love, It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love, It's gotta be love

It's gotta be love, be love, be love
It's gotta be love, be love, be love
