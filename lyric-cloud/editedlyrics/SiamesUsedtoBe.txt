You are not the one you used to be!

When she was still looking at him
While he was running off the dance floor
Pink was the sound
Squares on the ground
Mixed up with the sound
With the shame of disaster and the fire on the walls
She used to blame herself
Scared to death
Afraid to fail
But it was enough
So she played it rough
And said:

You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
You are not the one you used to be

If she was wrong, he was right
Oh it was so long was a blight 
Any spark would start a fight
They used to dance out of spite
And from the bottom of her soul she said:
"Leave him to me
I can't stand him anymore"
But it was enough
So she played it rough
And said:

You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
You are not the one you used to be

No matter how you walk into my place
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
Ah, you are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
'Cause you are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
You are not the one you used to be
