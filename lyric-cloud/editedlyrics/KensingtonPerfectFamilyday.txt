Focus on the rain
Dripping through every hole
Every night's the same
God has left this place
Left us on his way out
Risen questions stay

And it hopelessly went wrong
This tiresome masquerade
A perfect family day
Tragically displayed

Cover up these stains
Keeping up appearances
Jaded smiles remain
Watching fate take place
We're sulking and we're stumbling through
Grey and spiteful days

And it hopelessly went wrong
This tiresome masquerade
A perfect family day
Tragically displayed
