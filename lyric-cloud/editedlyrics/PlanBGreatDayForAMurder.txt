It was an ordinary day
People walking all over me again
Then suddenly to my dismay
Out of nowhere, my heart started talking to my brain
What a great day for a murder
But I'm not in a killing mood
What a great day to wreak vengeance
But I know it would do no good

What a great day to go and get a gun
Go and take your anger out on everyone
If you're out of ammunition, go and buy the Sun
And read up on all the council-housed and violent scum
Still pissing tax payers money up the Wall
While you can barely just about afford to send your kids to school
What with the cost of living been so sky high
And petrol stations selling gas at such a high price
With that in mind, and your heads in such a next place
What more excuse you need to turn into a head case
And the newspapers you read get you in such a vexed state
Kill a man with your bare hands, even if it was your best mate
Cause if you believe every word the press says
Till you you can't appreciate the pair of tits staring at you on the next page
Then yes I guess today must really be the best day
To go and get a gun, shoot someone in the head, mate

What a great day for a murder
But I'm not in a killing mood
What a great day to wreak vengeance
But I know it will do no good

Looking at the Sun will make you go blind just like people say
Cost you your sight as well as 30p a day
Now you're looking in the mirror, not seeing it's double-glazed
Prying on your neighbors through dark tinted shades
Another broken family, children roaming free
Look in every front yard of every house on the street
While the Guardian is guarding the Mail's planting seeds
Another single mum of four, new boyfriends every week
Daughters are reading Now, old dears feeling Heat
Her sons just like the Beano, catching laughs for cheap Young ones with their Nuts out blowing in the breeze
What a bunch of fucking animals, the type you only see
In the section of the Zoo magazine centre pages
Just lying on the floor, must be lining for their cages
She's seen enough, it's time to take abrasive-
Action with a shotgun wave it in people faces
Today's as good as any and there's nothing better then been famous
You could be the next Raoul Moat, have Max Clifford as your agent
He started exposing celebs for being aimless
Simply by shooting his neighbors and made the front page news in all the papers
Be just the Standard, Observer type of guy
That can't look anywhere without having murder in his eyes
So there's no point in killing everybody you despise
Over something you read, cause half the shit you read is lies
Yeah, that's right, half the shit you read is lies!
And you still let it lead your life!

It was an ordinary day
People walking all over me again
Then suddenly to my dismay
My heart started talking, yes, it started talking to my brain, he said


It'd do no good!, it'd do no good!
It'd do no good!, do no good!
It'd do no good, do no good!
It'd do no good!, do no good!
Do no good, do no good!
So now that you know you are so influenced by what you read
That it determines how you treat different people that you meet
The though of murdering a journalist, perpetuating such deceit
Must seem so sweet, if you happen to pass one in the street
But you won't because you are far too reserved to do shit
Only fantasize about what would happen if you were to lose it
Cause luckily for them, you ain't that stupid
And what a great day it is to prove it
