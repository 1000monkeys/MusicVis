I wake up to you laughing in your sleep
Beneath telephone lines, above burned out basements
You spit every word your pretty little mouth won’t keep
Then you wonder out loud “how the world keeps spinning”
I want everything inside that shed out back
All those penny nails and useless fertilizer
I wanna hear bolt cutters and breaking glass
Burning violins and your old man’s motorcycle
(Jana Misener sing/me reading Bernhard)
This isn’t love, but I need it just the same
This isn’t love but I need it just same
I want Tim to fix my transmission and say it’s alright
That it’ll work out fine, for Tim to say it one more time
While someone else’s satellite creeps across a flat black sky
And the one I built in Fifth Grade never left Mississippi
(Jana Misener sing/me reading Bernhard)
This isn’t love, but I need it just the same
This isn’t love but I need it just same
You and me we were born apart with the same last name, the same distance between us
I can still see the breath between our faces: frozen spirits in the air that night
I don’t wanna see their smiling mouths now turning against me, turning to rust
You kiss like a stone, but I need it just the same
(Jana Misener sing/me reading Bernhard)
This isn’t love, but I need it just the same. This isn’t love but I need it just same
This isn’t love…
(he had become the most sharp-witted fool of all) yep!
