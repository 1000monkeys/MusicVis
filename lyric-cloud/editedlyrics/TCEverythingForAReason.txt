I'm the golden child
King for the day
Travel through wires
Even jump into space
Tougher than tough
Drink all day
Smoke too much
Never work out and still win the race, because

Everything for a reason
Everything for a reason
Everything for a reason
I don't need a good reason, no
Everything for a reason
Everything for a reason
Everything for a reason
Should I need a good reason? No

Why do I have to give an explanation?
Life in slow motion
Looking for a reason, looking for a reason
Looking for a reason, reason, reason, I don't need a reason


Took a leap of faith
Standing in the fire
Dream within a dream
Shooting lazer beams
I can feel the force
Coming from you, girl
Drink all day, smoke too much
Never work out and still save the world, because
