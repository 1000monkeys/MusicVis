Deep down from the darkness
Rose a man, he was out of control
In his eyes the spark
That blows inflames his corrupted soul
I shook hands with the devil he said
Posing in the living room
I should make up for lost time he said
You know you should be leaving soon

You’d better run run run away from me
You’d better run run run away from me
You’d better run run run away from me
You’d better run run run, I count to three
(x2)

Hold my hand and come don’t be a fool
I’ll take you home
Not just anyone can become bad
Can do some harm
I shook hands with the devil he said
Posing in the living room
I should make up for lost time he said
You know you should be leaving soon

You’d better run run run away from me
You’d better run run run away from me
You’d better run run run away from me
You’d better run run run, I count to three
(x2)
