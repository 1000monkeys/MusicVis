Oh I love you so, darling
I've never felt this way before, darling
I want you more and more, my love
We have so much to explore, my love
I can't get enough of you
You are my drug
There's no other way to tell it
I'm addicted to you
I'll always be by your side, darling
You're the best thing in my life, darling
I won't tell nothing new, whatever
My heart belongs to you, forever
I can't get enough of you
You are my drug
There's no other way to tell it
I'm addicted to you
Oh I love you so, darling
I've never felt this way before, darling
I want you more and more, my love
We have so much to explore, my love
I'll always be by your side, darling
You're the best thing in my life, darling
I won't tell nothing new, whatever
My heart belongs to you, forever
I can't get enough of you
You are my drug
There's no other way to tell it
I'm addicted to you
