Somewhere in the system
Trace of what we've been
A ceiling behind the sunset
Flicker on the dark screen
And we're tired and broken down
Both sign rust and cheap
The silence in the circuit
Brings me back to you again
Always been so sure we saw the same thing
So sure we saw the same thing
Always been so, always been so
Always been so sure we saw the same thing
Oh, waving at the time back
Bells and broken secrets say:
"Cold, we can't crack"
Oh, and the clouds are moving too fast
Every fall will pull apart
I know we'll always be that, oh, friend
Somewhere in the distance
Ghosts of what we've been
The cracks behind the sunset
Flicker on the dark screen
When we're tired and broken down
Both sign rust and cheap
The silence in the circuit
Brings me back to you again
Always been so sure we saw the same thing
So sure we saw the same thing
Always been so, always been so
Always been so sure we saw the same thing
Oh, waving at the time back
Bells and broken secrets say:
"Cold, we can't crack"
Oh, and the clouds are moving too fast
Every fall will pull apart
I know we'll always be that, oh, friend
