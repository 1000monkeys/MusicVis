You were so pretty on the small screen
But you look so different in the flesh though
You've got the weight of the world on your ice cold shoulders
So it's so difficult to get an answer from you

When I say that
"Where have you been and how much you been smokin'?
What do you mean when you say that you love me?"
But you're never home and so

You wanna get a little bit closer to me
You better step back and look at yourself, baby
You wanna live just like kings and queens, then
You better step back and look at yourself, baby
Get a little closer

You're locked in your cellphone, oh
You've not looked up at me in a while now
You got the world in your hands, but your hands are frozen
So it's so difficult to get an answer from you
