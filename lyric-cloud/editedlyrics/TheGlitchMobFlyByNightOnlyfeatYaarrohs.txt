Fly by night, only
On my watch, babe

Take a ride outside with me
Just for a little while
Feel the wind brush back the road
And clean you of your lies
There's a tone I tend to touch
A deepened lust from which I fall
And the racing heart will beat
Endlessly into the dark

Take a ride outside with me
Just for a little while
Feel the wind brush back the road
And clean you of your lies
There's a tone I tend to touch
A deepened lust from which I fall
And the racing heart will beat
Endlessly into the dark

In darkness ascend
I take to the night, again

Fly by night, only
