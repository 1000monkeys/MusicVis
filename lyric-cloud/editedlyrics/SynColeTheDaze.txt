The sky is falling but I didn't notice a thing
I heard the angels calling
Now maybe I'm lost in a daze

Mazes and mirrors
I'm not seeing clear when you're here, when you're here
Magic and moonshine
I'll dive in your high tide, my dear, my dear

I'm lost in a daze
Daze, daze, daze
I'm lost in a daze
Daze, daze, daze

The sky is falling but I didn't notice a thing
I heard the angels calling
Now maybe I'm lost in a daze

Mazes and mirrors
I'm not seeing clear when you're here, when you're here
Magic and moonshine
I'll dive in your high tide, my dear, my dear

I'm lost in a daze
Daze, daze, daze
I'm lost in a daze
Daze, daze, daze
