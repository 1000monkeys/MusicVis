On Drakkares Of Fate
The light blazes in darkness
Salvation for us
As the lighthouse among the rocks
I searched for it all my life
There was a path I walked
Searching the road to darkness
Among the sea I saw an abyss
And among ruined rocks
Making the way on waves in darkness
On drakkares of the fate
We have seen the light
That called us on the coast of life
Calls, on the coast, under the firmament
On the coast of life, where there is no darkness
Making my way among the rocks
To the light of the lighthouse
The way to heaven amongst all the evil
The wave has covered me again
And in my mouth remained the taste of sin
But the boart is damaged away
From the land and the coast
I row with all my strength
Waves are breaking in on board
And wind renders the sail almost useless
And I sail towards the light of the lighthouse
Through the storm of adversities
Stars hid in darkness
And the moon has tried to shine
But light, beckoning me
Does not allow me to get lost among the darkness
Light, beckoning me, light that calls me
Light, beckoning me, light of the Lord
The path for the ones, who once searched for
The road away from darkness
Among the abyss of sea
And among ruined rocks
Making the way on waves in darkness
On drakkares of fate
We have seen the light
That called us to the coast of life
Where there is no darkness
Making my way among rocks
To the light of the lighthouse
My way through evil, towards heaven
To heaven
