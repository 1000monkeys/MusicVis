Oh that I had, the wing of a dove, to rest on me
This is not new to me
As I sit in this boat
But I'm so cold my bones, will freeze
And there's nought through the haze
I've been waiting so long
But my hour has gone, away
Oh that I had, the wing of a dove, to rest on me
This is not new to me
As I sit in this boat
But I'm so cold my bones, will freeze
And there's nought through the haze
I've been waiting so long
But my hour has gone, away
To fly back with, a branch in its beak, to rescue me
Oh that I had, the wing of a dove, to rest on me
This is not new to me
As I sit in this boat
But I'm so cold my bones, will freeze
Oh that 
Oh that I had, the wing of a dove, to rest on me
This is not new to me
As I sit in this boat
But I'm so cold my bones, will freeze
And there's nought through the haze
I've been waiting so long
But my hour has gone, away
He navigates, when I've lost my way
He reminds me, to lift my eyes
Oh that I had, the wing of a dove, to rest on me
