Dusty headlights and I can't see
I feel the wind of the south blowing through the tree
Shaky dreams are killing me
I feel the coals of the fire underneath my feet

I feel the coals of the fire underneath my feet
I'm looking for something

I'll pick you up
When this road gets too rough
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog
I'll be your light when you're stuck in this night
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog

You ain't a man if you choose my path
I get scared when I leave like I ain't coming back
Lonely bars in the same old class
Well it's hard when they love you and you can't love them back

Well it's hard when you love them and they can't love you back
I'm looking for something

I'll pick you up
When this road gets too rough
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog
I'll be your light when you're stuck in this night
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog

Maybe that sun will shine
Maybe I'm scared to know what I like
Maybe there ain't much time
Maybe I'm here to make you cry

I'll pick you up
When this road gets too rough
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog
I'll be your light when you're stuck in this night
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog
I'll be your dog
And I'll be your dog
