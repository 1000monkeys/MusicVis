I'm searching for an answer, a meaning, a reason why
I'm searching for a reason to see you
I'm promised nothing and would never expect the time
I'm searching, oh, I am searching

I don't want anymore of this
When I'm staring into the abyss
I don't want anymore of this
When I'm staring into the abyss of love
Into the abyss of love
Into the abyss of love

I'm searching for a meaning, a reason, an answer why
I'm searching for a reason to see you
I'm promised nothing and would never expect the time
I'm searching, oh, I am searching

I don't want anymore of this
When I'm staring into the abyss
I don't want anymore of this
When I'm staring into the abyss of love
Into the abyss of love
Into the abyss of love
I don't want anymore of this
When I'm staring into the abyss
I don't want anymore of this
When I'm staring into the abyss of love
Into the abyss of love
