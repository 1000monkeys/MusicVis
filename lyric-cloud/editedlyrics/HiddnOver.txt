I'm not going anywhere
'Cause I'm here to stay, I'm here to play
Get used to it
Nothing's gonna bring me down
Got a little taste of it
And now, I want more
And I can't ignore the feel of it
Nothing's gonna stop me now

Fire on the ground, got 'em running for cover
Better watch out, I'm about to take over
I don't got time to look over my shoulder
Leave 'em all behind, I'm about to take over

You wanna get competitive
But I stay on top, yeah, I call the shots
Get used to it
Nothing's gonna bring me down
Feeling that adrenaline
The rush in my veins, fuel to the flame
I live for it
Nothing's gonna stop me now

'Cause I got news for you
I can't lose, no, no
'Cause I am golden
And I will never back down
'Cause I got news for you
And I can't lose, no, no
'Cause I am golden
And I'm about to take over

Fire on the ground, got 'em running for cover
Better watch out, I'm about to take over
I don't got time to look over my shoulder
Leave 'em all behind, I'm about to take over

I'm about to take over
I'm about to take over
I'm about to take over
