{VERSE 1:MR.RIP}
Showtime niggas rip is in the buildin'
This is my playground and you rappers my children
I ain't a local rapper, but you should know that
I kill the booth,where da fuck the toe tag
I'll be fresh as hell if the feds watchin'
She'll be wet as hell when the bed is rockin
Everything I spit is top notch
And you rappers are squares, I use your face for hop scotch
Fuck these niggas...white power
In the booth I leave magic, Dwight Howard
Got people asking if Im solo
Cause I keep few in my circle,like a snow globe
Ain't nothing change but my age nigga
Same gun, ain't nothing change but the gauge nigga
Am I best? Im willing to take bets
You haters are dead to me, you just failed an aids test
We all know you gay, dont make it obvious
Theae niggas think the ballin, Jason Collins
Miami Heat on my snapback
Carry 941, manatee is in my backpack
I earn respect you niggas handfed
Im killin these rappers aaron hernandez
My murder weapon is a microphone
She say baby you the shit, I say leave my diaper on
Got a bad bitch and she a sweet freak
And I just bang bang like im chief keef
Free all of my niggas man
Then lock up george zimmerman
Everyday I pray that I make a million
Either I make it rappin' or I make it livin
Thia ain't a game you wanna play with me?
All black, red dot, playstation 3
Now im sounding like a tough cat
I make your girl cum for that 20, like a touchback
Bitch Im Mr.Rip, dont act tough partner
You going to jail now, slap you like the bus driver
Beat up the track like it stole something
Then I come back like I was owed something
Beat up the track like it stole something
My music so cold, bitch I think my nose running
I told them I ain't a local rapper
I showed them I ain't a local rapper
I ain't flowin like im a local rapper
But you should know that
And nigga this ain't local rap
Easy
