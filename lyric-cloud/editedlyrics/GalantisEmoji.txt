The night was young, we were growing up
Yeah, I know but I don't know enough
I know it’s late, just got back from work
You don't have to put it into words

Ooh-wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh-wee
Send me an emoji-ji-ji (Hey)
Ooh-wee (Ooh, ooh)
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh-wee (Ooh, ooh)
Send me an emoji-ji-ji (Hey)

Ooh-wee
Ooh-wee
Send me an emoji-ji-ji (Hey)

Left your weed in my vanity
Only hit it when it's hard to sleep

One more glass of tequila poured
If you were here, we’d down a couple more
Souvenirs you left in my draw
Got them Princess Leia braids you wore
Left your weed in my vanity
Only hit it when it's hard to sleep

Ooh-wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh-wee
Send me an emoji-ji-ji (Hey)
Ooh-wee (Ooh, ooh)
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh-wee (Ooh, ooh)
Send me an emoji-ji-ji (Hey)

Ooh-wee (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh-wee (Ooh, ooh)
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
