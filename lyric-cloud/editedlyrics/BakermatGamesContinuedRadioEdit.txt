You got the gun
I’ve got the flower
You’ve got your pride
I’ve got my shame
You’ve got your luck
What the hell is mine
but you’re Dark
And I’m Bright

I’m not the flame
And you are the first
Let me explode let me burst
Let me shout shout shout shout shout shout shout
Let me shout shout
Let me shout shout shout shout shout shout shout
Let me shout shout

Funniest game
Strongest pain
Hardest time
Hardest time
