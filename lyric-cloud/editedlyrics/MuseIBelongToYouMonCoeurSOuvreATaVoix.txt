When these pillars get pulled down
It will be you who wears the crown
And I'll owe everything to you
How much pain has cracked your soul?
How much love would make you whole?
You're my guiding lightning strike

I can't find the words to say
They're overdue
I've travelled half the world to say
I belong to you

Then she attacks me like a Leo
When my heart is split like Rio
And I assure you my debts are real

I can't find the words to say

Ah! Réponds, réponds à ma tendresse
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse
Réponds à ma tendresse
Réponds à ma tendresse
Ahhh verse-moi l'ivresse
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse
Réponds à ma tendresse
Réponds à ma tendresse
Ahhh verse-moi l'ivresse
I belong
I belong to you alone

-se
I can't find the words to say
They're overdue
Travelled half the world to say
I belong to you
