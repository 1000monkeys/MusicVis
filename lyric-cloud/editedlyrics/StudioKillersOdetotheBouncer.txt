Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do

No, I haven't had no dope
Lift up the velvet rope
Mr. Doorman, stop teasing
I'm freezing out here
See, I've got friends inside
It's my birthday tonight
And I'm not wearing trainers
Not to mention knickers
It's futile to debate
With St. Peter at the gate
Made of protein milkshake
And low carb intake
'Cause all in all you're just
Another prick at the door

Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do
Bouncer, hey bouncer
Bouncer, bounce bounce bouncer
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical
Bouncer, bouncer

Ooh, bouncer, empowered and aroused
I see it in your trousers
And in the way you browse her
(Look she's in!)
What?! Her dress is up to waterline
Bitch is clearly borderline
Nose as white as Snow White's, in moonlight
We stand in awe, in front of
Another prick at the door

Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do
Bouncer, hey bouncer
Bouncer, bounce bounce bouncer
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical
Bouncer, bouncer

So you can play karate
You thick illiterati
I'm a black belt in life
So go home to your ugly wife!
You forgot, in your wisdom
The window to the ladies' room
A whole new possibility
For a cat like me

Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do
Bouncer, hey bouncer
Bouncer, bounce bounce bouncer
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical
