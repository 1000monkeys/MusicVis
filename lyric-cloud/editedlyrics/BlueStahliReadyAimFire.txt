Seven million strung out on ambition
Sea of relay high rise in remission
All with a hope and a plan to make it out
Give up the ghost when they try to push it down
Now

Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire

Die a thousand deaths in hesitation
Far beyond the spark of inspiration
Close to the soul and away from all the doubt
Live what is known when you hear the softest sound
Say

Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire

Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire

Fire
Ready, aim, fire
Fire
Fire
