No mercy for you
No worries for you
That Game of Thrones
Go Cersei on you
I flip the script
I roll the dice
Don't fall sleep
Cause I'm working nights
You trynna shut me out it's getting blatant
I'll come and see you now no hesitation
I'm really really tired of being patient
If you won't give it to me imma take it
Take it
If you won't give it to me imma take it
Take it
If you won't give it to me imma take it
What if they never told ya
That the world wasn't round would you flip it over?
You playing poker with the joker boy let's keep it kosher
Momma yo son finna go supernova
Keep your focus
Really I just might
Spazz out in this place
Got that war paint on my face
Just been running round in this race
Feels like I been running in place
Now I got hella bling
Got hella rings
I'm ready now
Send every team
Y'all slept on me
That's hella dream
Don't take time, take everything
You trynna shut me out it's getting blatant
I'll come and see you now no hesitation
I'm really really tired of being patient
If you won't give it to me imma take it
Take it
If you won't give it to me imma take it
Take it
If you won't give it to me imma take it
