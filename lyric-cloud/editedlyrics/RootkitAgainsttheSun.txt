Chase the wind and touch the sky
A stars light shines on long after it dies
Oh oh oh whoa oh
In the night
Live everyday as if it's your last
Our memories burn bright like beacons of the past
Oh oh oh whoa oh
In the night

Now we race against the sun
Now we race against the sun
Ooh wooh ooh ooh
Now we race against the sun
Now we race against the sun
Ooh wooh ooh ooh

Race against the sun
Now we race against the sun
Race against the sun
Now we race against the sun

Now we race against the sun
Now we race against the sun
Ooh wooh ooh ooh
