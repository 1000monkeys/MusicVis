I wish people would stop yelling and start listening
I wish birds would start talking and stop whistling
Cause they know things that I don’t know
Seven of them sitting on that wall
Staring at a lost soul and fly away
Too close to the window
I’m looking for some info
Can I trust Google Maps’ photographs
What’s flying like, are you free above
Is it really that worth, dreaming of
Or does that to get old like making love and alcohol
Or that track you wrote that made them all dance on the dancingfloor
But the dancing floor, it ends at four
When the dancing people have to go
And there is nothing left for you to roll, than home

Sun don’t shine at night
Oh no, it don’t
If only you would just open your eyes
I know i’m not alone
Is it alright if all these words don’t mean nothing at all
I wish I was from a broken home
To explain the fact that i’m cold and alone
But my family is golden so it’s probably just my own fault again
I wish those seven birds came back
And told me why this earth is wack
Cause it ain’t sync what we deserve and get
Or do you think we should work on that
Sunday evening, monday is eager to kill me like he did last week
I’m not the guy you think you need
I wish that you start missing me
And start distinguishing you and I
For we are the same and you’re in my mind
But rain replaces snow and that’s just pretty fucking lame
