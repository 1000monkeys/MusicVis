Come out while the rain is gone
Slow down, breathe in on your own
And the world keeps spinning around while we dive in it
And the world is bringing us down leaving marks on our skin

Cold wind beneath our wings
Breezing out 'till we let it in
Don't we all fall? Don't we all fall?
Chasing lights of the dying limbs
Change won't come if we don't begin
Don't we all fall? Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?

Stone cold by the silver sea
Ripped out of this make-believe
And we all keep travelling 'till the lights kick in
While we all keep climbing the walls chasing marks on our skin

Cold wind beneath our wings
Breezing out 'till we let it in
Don't we all fall? Don't we all fall?
Chasing lights of the dying limbs
Change won't come if we don't begin
Don't we all fall? Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?

Wailing winds come sailing in
Softly as a dusty sea
Fading out a covering
Giving warmth a place in life
The arctic sun shines in the night
Falling stars out of the sky
(Don't we all fall?)
(Don't we all fall?)
(Don't we all fall?)
(Don't we all fall?)
(Don't we all fall?)

Cold wind beneath our wings
Breezing out 'till we let it in
Don't we all fall? Don't we all fall?
Chasing lights of the dying limbs
Change won't come if we don't begin
Don't we all fall? Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?
Don't we all fall?
