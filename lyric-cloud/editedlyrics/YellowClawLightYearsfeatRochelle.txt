Electric nights, like fireflies
Time is frozen
Velvet skies, like lightning vibes
We be floating

'Cause when you touch me, I swear I can't speak
Out of body, there ain't no coming back
And when you touch me, it's what my heart needs
And we can run free, I know that

We can be light years away
I know I can find you
We can be light years away
I know we can shine through
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know I can find you
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know we can shine through

Yellow motherfucking Claw

Worlds apart, we're shooting stars
Skies are open
A ray of sparks, our beating hearts
Throw us in motion

'Cause when you touch me, I swear I can't speak
Out of body, there ain't no coming back
And when you touch me, it's what my heart needs
And we can run free, I know that

We can be light years away
I know I can find you
We can be light years away
I know we can shine through
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know I can find you
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know we can shine through

Yellow motherfucking Claw

Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
