Whisper it loud
Just let me know
Symbolize
Could let me go

Sometimes it's over before we can doubt it
Turns to dust and then it's gone
Saturate enough to be blinded
These colors don't belong

I've been falling in my dreams
But now I'm wide awake watching it all go down
If dreams aren't really what they seem
Then why am I wide awake watching it all go down?

Changed my ways
For better days
A simple haze
Say our name

Sometimes it's over before we can doubt it
Turns to dust and then it's gone
Saturate enough to be blinded
These colors don't belong

I've been falling in my dreams
But now I'm wide awake watching it all go down
If dreams aren't really what they seem
Then why am I wide awake watching it all go down?
Been falling in my dreams
But now I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
If dreams aren't really what they seem
Then why am I wide awake watching it all go down?

I won't call you by your given name
I'll call you by your spirit animal
I caught you like a living flame
You caught me just the same

I've been falling in my dreams
But now I'm wide awake watching it all go down
If dreams aren't really what they seem
Then why am I wide awake watching it all go down?
Been falling in my dreams
But now I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
If dreams aren't really what they seem
Then why am I wide awake watching it all go down?
