The night is gettin' colder under city lights
Lonely souls, they stagger like they've all gone blind
There is something bigger in the dark tonight
Dancing with the devil in the cold, cold rain
I'm not making deals because I know the game
Stealing all the secrets 'cause I need that flame

Strike a match
I'm gonna strike a match
Watch me strike a match
And burn it down
Yeah, I'm gonna burn it down

This is not so typical, the way it ends
When you start a fire, you can't just pretend
That you don't love the feeling in your blood it brings

Strike a match
I'm gonna strike a match
Watch me strike a match
And burn it down
Yeah, I'm gonna burn it down

I'm gonna strike a match, and burn it
I'm gonna strike a match, and burn it
I'm gonna strike a match, and burn it down

Strike a match
I'm gonna strike a match
Watch me strike a match
And burn it down
Strike a match (I'm gonna strike a match, and burn it)
I'm gonna strike a match (I'm gonna strike a match, and burn it)
Watch me strike a match (I'm gonna strike a match, and burn it)
And burn it down
Yeah, I'm gonna burn it down

Yeah, burn it down
Burn it down
Yeah, just burn it down
