We were lost in the dark but we've opened the door
We're afraid cause this thing's never happened before
There's a fear making noise in the back of your head
But there's no need to be afraid crawl back in my bed
Get in line for the sunshine
Get in line for the sunshine
Calm down and get in cause we're ready to go
There's no point in holding back cause it's out of control
Is it brown? is it blue? is it black? is it dead?
Don't you worry 'bout a thing crawl back in my bed
Get in line for the sunshine
Get in line for the sunshine
