Tell me, tell me, tell me your problems
(I'm here for you)
Try just, try just, try just to stay sober
(It's eating you)
You say you are a monster
But what I see is a child
Your eyes, your eyes are glowing red
And your tongue has caught on fire
(You are golden, you are pure)
(You are golden)
So let go, let go all of your fire
Let it go, let go all of your fire
Live it up, don't crash in the smoke in the end
Let it go, let go all of your fire
You play, you play, you play up to them
(But they're not around)
Don't be, don't be so rough with me
(When you are a gem)
They ask how I can love you
When all they see is this
But I see the things that you can't contain
And what it does to you
(You are golden, you are pure)
(You are golden)
So let go, let go all of your fire
Let it go, let go all of your fire
Live it up, don't crash in the smoke in the end
Let it go, let go all of your fire
(Let go, let go, let go, let go)
(Let go, let go, let go, let go)
(You are golden, you are pure)
(You are golden)
So let go, let go all of your fire
Let it go, let go all of your fire
Live it up, don't crash in the smoke in the end
Let it go, let go all of your fire
(Let go, let go, let go, let go)
(Let go, let go, let go, let go)
