Haunted by a runaway
I’m still breathing without you
But I’m still walking beside you
All the time
Hurting like a throwaway
There’s a heart beating inside you
It’s hard believing without you
All the time
All I ever wanted was a chance
And to stand beside you
To stand beside and see you heart believe
And I never wanted more
Than to stand beside you
To stand beside and see your heart believe
Haunted by holy days
What was said and still to say
Promises we gave away
Can we come undone?
So how are we going to walk away?
If it’s over now, you say it’s over now
All I ever wanted was a chance
And to stand beside you
To stand beside and see you heart believe
And I never wanted more
Than to stand beside you
To stand beside and see your heart believe
I’m still running after
Still dreaming after
Still healing after, all the time
It’s all we ever wanted
All we ever need and more
Until it’s finally over
Is it finally over now?
All I ever wanted was a chance
And to stand beside you
To stand beside and see you heart believe
And I never wanted more
Than to stand beside you
To stand beside and see your heart believe
