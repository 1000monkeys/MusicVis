These are the new mystics
The new misfits
Truth on their lips
Like they just kissed it
Eyes open wide so they don't miss it
The future is wild and our style is running it
These are the new mystics
The new misfits
Fist raised in praise of existence
Children of drums
Driven by bass kicks
Watching the sunset
Burn down the matrix
And our style is running it
Eyes open wide so they don't miss it
The future is wild and our style is running it
These are the new mystics
The new misfits
Truth on their lips
Like they just kissed it
Eyes open wide so they don't miss it
The future is wild and our style is running it
And our style is running it
