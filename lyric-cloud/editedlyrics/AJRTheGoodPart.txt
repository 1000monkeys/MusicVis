Have I done my best here
Or will I be here next year
Or are these my best years yet?
Was looking forward to
Being important but
I'm not important yet

If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the work gets me where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
Can we skip to the good part?

If there's a good part then
I hope it's not far 'cause
I thought it'd be today
I napped on campus and
I smoked at dances but
It didn't feel so great

If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the work gets me where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
So can we skip to the good part?

These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But what am I gonna do with mine?
These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But what the hell am I gonna do with mine?
