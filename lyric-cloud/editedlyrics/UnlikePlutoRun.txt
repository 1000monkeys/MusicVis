Because run, run, run
Bobby run before the cops get on your case
You don't know what you've done
But it's time we all escape

Because it sure was a good time we had away
But now, it feels like it's gone away

We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay

Cause if I was, if only I was taking the next flight over
I would stand tall and fight back
And I know that you are waiting for the sun
And I know that they won't stop until we're gone

Because it sure was a good time we had away
But now, it feels like it's gone away

We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
We can't stay
