They call it "New Love", well that's the tagline anyway
It's faster, thicker, stronger than the rest around
She's got a crazy streak, I think it was made for me
But when I try to speak, I get cut down
Well she says I am just not ready for these problems that I cause
And I'd be better off if I was left ignored
But what can I say, I'm falling endlessly for you, for you, for you
Well I'm feeling I'm succeeding, something tell's me I'm not
Cause what I need and what I want just ain't the same anymore
I've been used I've been confused but still ain't got what I want
I know... I just gotta learn to cope
But if I can't, what happens then?
I do my best but don't succeed
I get these thoughts now and then
She's been playing games with me
I can't wait any longer, I'm doing what I can
I'm gonna be stronger, be a better man
I'm gonna do better, I'm gonna do better
I've got to be better, ooh...
Well she says I am just not ready for these problems that I cause
And I'd be better off if I was left ignored
But what can I say, I'm falling endlessly for you, for you, for you
