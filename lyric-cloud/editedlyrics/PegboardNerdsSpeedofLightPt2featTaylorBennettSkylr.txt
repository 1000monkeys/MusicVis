Yup, yup, yup
Taylor Bennett
Speed of light

Speed of light I'm breaking down like this ain't nothing new
She wanna kick it don't skip it, let's say we rendezvous
Usually I don't trick a pickup, like one or two
Them daisies known to be jelly, especially if I love you
I've grown impatient, I'm tired of waiting just for you
If we gon' trip then we takin' trips out to Malibu
My allyoops used to returning truth from a blowing nuke
A bomb crash and I'm slow askin' to tell the truth

Taking off yeah, I'll be on my way now
Feel it in the air 'cause I'm in a better place now
I never doubted, no I never doubted
(If you don't like that, leave it where you found it)
Yup (At the speed of light)
I ain't cuttin' that pie, I'm savin' half for you
(Speed of light) Yup
(Speed of light) Yup
I ain't cuttin' that pie, I'm savin' half for you

Won't slow down
Won't slow down
Speed of light
Hey Taylor I got you
Won't slow down
Uh, look
Speed of light

I'm savin' half for you 'cause I got it bad for ya
Don't you ever trip about it we can even passport it
You deserve it you ain't even gotta ask for it
Life's a marathon and I wouldn't wanna fast-forward
And for the love it was back and forth like tennis
Indy down to Atlanta like every weekend no matter
What we had on the schedule progressin' with every pedal
Momentum at speed of light, I need me like 20 medals, yes

I'm taking off yeah, I'll be on my way now
Feel it in the air 'cause I'm in a better place now
I never doubted, no I never doubted
(If you don't like that, leave it where you found it)

Breaking down, nothing new
Won't slow down
Let's say we rendezvous
One or two
Especially if I love you
Speed of light
Just for you
Trips out to Malibu
Speed of light
From a blowing nuke
Speed of light
Catch me
Catch me
Catch me
Speed of Light

I'm taking off yeah, I'll be on my way now
Feel it in the air cause I'm in a better place now
I never doubted, no I never doubted
I feel it in the air cause I'm in a better place now
I'm taking off yeah, I'll be on my way now
Feel it in the air cause I'm in a better place now
I never doubted, no I never doubted
I feel it in the air cause I'm in a better place now

Won't slow down
Won't slow down (Speed of light)
Won't slow down (Speed of light)
