Two lies, back to back
Two years, now it's past (Now it's past)
Two fears, come to pass
Too near, this can't last (This can't last)

Broken glass is covering the floor now
The bottles I poured out
Tried to purge myself of everything about you
But when you always show up on my doorstep, oh-oh-oh

Choking on your every word, your every desire
While I gasp for air, you just stand and stare
Choking on you like nicotine
My lungs are on fire but I won't die today
'Cause you will kill me slowly

I don't wanna feel like something's wrong (But something is)
Yeah, I don't wanna blindly just move on (But you know you will)
When I'm wasting daylight sleeping on the west side
Maybe I can stop time, I know
Know that you, know that you won't

I know that I can't seem to move on
(Don't move on, don't move on)
And free myself from you
(Don't move on, oh)

Choking on your every word, your every desire
While I gasp for air, you just stand and stare
Choking on you like nicotine
My lungs are on fire but I won't die today
'Cause you will kill me slowly

Words are creeping in they're not mine
(You will do what I say)
Maybe I am losing my mind (You will do what I think)
Maybe I am hanging by your strings
(You're gonna move with me)
I, you are alone with me

I know that I can't seem to move on
(Don't move on, don't move on)
And free myself from you
(Don't move on, oh)

Choking on your every word, your every desire, oh, yeah
While I gasp for air, you just stand and stare
Choking on you like nicotine
My lungs are on fire but I won't die today
'Cause you will kill me slowly
