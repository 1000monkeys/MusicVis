If I'm going to hell, I'm going out kicking
It's my soul to sell, but my heart's sinking
As the whole world is watching me
Pushing me down on my knees
They never hear my shouting "please"
So I rhyme 'till I'm free

Say yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah

Feel my pulse beat a thousand times a minute
Don't wake me up just let me dream
As I watch the world go crashing down
Oh my God it's giving me the shivers
This must be real I can't escape
Can we start the countdown 'till the end?

Say yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah

Say yeah, say yeah, say yeah, say yeah
