I don't wanna be your game, you love to keep me hoping
I've had enough of your bullshit, now I am folding
Every time I hear your name, the memory's just holding
I should've known that you'd play me, now I am broken

So don't tell me no, now that you drove me crazy
Cause I know my doors are closing
I don't really need you, baby
So don't tell me no, that's not what I'm looking for
Cause I know that you just play me
I'm not your monopoly no more

Every little thing I crave from all the thrills I'm chasing
Reasons I kept returning to problems I'm always facing
I don't wanna run your race or touch that rope you're throwing
I should've known that you'd play me, now I am broken

So don't tell me no, now that you drove me crazy
Cause I know my doors are closing
I don't really need you, baby
So don't tell me no, that's not what I'm looking for
Cause I know that you'll just play me
I'm not your monopoly no more

So don't tell me no, now that you drove me crazy
Cause I know my doors are closing
I don't really need you, baby
So don't tell me no, that's not what I'm looking for
Cause I know that you'll just play me
I'm not your monopoly no more
So don't tell me no, now that you drove me crazy
Cause I know my doors are closing
I don't really need you, baby
So don't tell me no, that's not what I'm looking for
Cause I know that you just play me
I'm not your monopoly no more
