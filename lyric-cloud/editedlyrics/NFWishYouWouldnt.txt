We gotta talk about things
We gotta do something different
'Cause this isn't working, this isn't working
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
Riding 'round the city, baby
I know you wish you could change me
Why you mad? Girl, why you angry?
Yeah, why you angry?
Back and forth, you love you hate me
Arguing about the same things
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
I don't, I don't know anymore, baby I don't know anymore

I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean

Yeah, I mean she wants somebody that's working a 9-to-5
I apologize, but those ain't my hours, yeah you never been with a man
Who's working this kinda job, who works with this kind of drive, I wouldn't be with me either
Hold up, yeah I think that's work on the other line, I gotta go, we can argue some another time
Hang up the phone, I regret it right after
This is the chance that I just  couldn't pass up
See I signed a deal, you said I should've asked ya
I guess I was scared to see how you reacted
Or maybe I knew I'd be selfish
These are the things I ain't proud of
I's always the type to get jealous, there's always two sides of the story
And you're not the one that I blame when I tell it, that's real, yeah
You ain't the one, you ain't the one
I mean I should've manned up and that's hard to say as a man
The older I get the more I understand a relationship's more than just holding her hand
I'm sorry, you can blame me, yeah, you can blame me

I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean

What's going on?
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel something
There's too many things I'm tryna deal with
And I understand that you don't feel this
I said there's too many things I'm tryna deal with (No)
And I understand I'm hurting your feelings
I know you don't feel this, yeah (Baby)
I'm just expressing the way that I'm feeling
The things that I'm trying to deal with
I guess I've been trying to hold it all inside
But it's obvious that that ain't working
Yeah it's obvious that that ain't working
The only thing we got in common
Is that we got nothing in common (Woo!), baby
