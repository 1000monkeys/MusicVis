Forever and ever, even today and after
I kept your picture forever
Back in the late fifties, we went to the prom and kissing
But you went home with Tom Ripley

Throw the guy a meat bone, put him on a train
That's the way it should end
Living on the outskirts, forty miles away
Where the lonely road ends

Forever and ever, even today and after
I still believe you can hear me
Believer, deceiver, the question lies beneath the
Letter I wrote you in late May

Throw the guy a meat bone, put him on a train
That's the way it should end
Living on the outskirts, forty miles away
Where the lonely road ends

Where the lonely road ends
Where the guitar gangsters sing
