All my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
Wrong reasons

This time of year, I'm feelin' weird, might be allergies
Wanna move out, but when I move out, who'll be proud of me
Thought I was made, from men that were great, put that crown on me
Thought I was made, from Louis C.K

But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Wrong reasons

I used to say, just what's on my brain, 'cause you always did
You used to be, so special to me, now you've taken it
Look at this mess, should I forget, what you gave to me?
Look at this mess, wake up Mr. West

Cause, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
And, I will unravel if you rip away my best pieces
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Wrong reasons

Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah
Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah
Would've never come so far without someone there to start it
Can I truly love the art when I kinda hate the artist?
But, all my role models are on TV for the wrong reasons
(Ah, ahh-ah-ah, ah, ahh-ah-ah)
Wrong reasons
