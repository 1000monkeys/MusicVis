All aboard, hit the road
All the bullshit can't be ignored
It's hard to place in my face
No emotion

All the problems make me wanna go
Like a bad girl straight to video
Little darling, welcome to the show
You're a failure played in stereo

Heidi ho, here we go
No solution, strong undertow
Quite unfair, quite a pair
No box office

All the problems make me wanna go
Like a bad girl straight to video
Little darling, welcome to the show
You're a failure played in stereo

I never noticed, no, never noticed
You're so amazing, so a-a-mazing
I never noticed, no, never noticed
You're so amazing, so a-a-mazing

All aboard, hit the road
All aboard, here we go

All the problems make me wanna go
Like a bad girl straight to video
Little darling, welcome to the show
You're a failure played in stereo

I never noticed, no, never noticed
You're so amazing, so a-a-mazing
I never said it, no, never said it
You're suffocating, suffocating
I never noticed, no, never noticed
Your beauty's fading, it's fa-fa-fading
