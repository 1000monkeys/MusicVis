You always got an explanation
Some hesitation
Oh I know
There's no need for all this tension
You're not addressing
But I know
You're talking with your body
But your lips are saying different words
You speak a different language
Don't you understand how bad it hurts, baby?
So tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you're feeling when you're looking at me
Tell me what to say
Maybe it's too soon
I'm swimming through the grey but I can't find you
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
You say that you just don't believe me
But now you're leaving alone
But baby listen, do you hear me
When I speak clearly about what I want?
You're talking with your body
But your lips are saying different words
You speak a different language
Don't you understand how bad it hurts?
So tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you're feeling when you're looking at me
Tell me what to say
Maybe it's too soon
I'm swimming through the grey but I can't find you
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
So tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you're feeling when you're looking at me
Tell me what to say
Maybe it's too soon
I'm swimming through the grey but I can't find you
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
Now I'm black & blue
