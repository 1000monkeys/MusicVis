Didd verse
I’ve been where you are, you gon make It far
Believing in yourself, you gon be a star
I see you looking down, but please don’t look so hard
I’m tryna build you up but you keep blocking off
Its all up in your mind, just be patient ma
I know you want it now, but its gon take some time
You say you want it fast, thinkin its gon last
But even in the future you gon have a past
Even if you front them, they gon put you last
They gon put a quarter, make you put in half
Niggas love to pump fake put a quarter-back
Rhyme scheme fine I can chiropract
I don’t need a license just to break ya back
That’s just my opinion, and I think its fact
Don’t ever leave a nigga just to turn ya back
Don’t ever let emotions come and run you mad
You can be my line I’ll be your running back
And if you make some time, I’m finna capsule that
Put it in a bottle like Aladdin’s dad
Then I make a wish, and wish that I could have
A moment of your time so I can make you laugh
And show you that you beautiful, and what you have
A moment of your time so I can make you laugh
Ain’t no fallin imma catch you, you ain’t gotta ask
BRA Jr. Verse
They say my city only love you if you rap or play ball
Guess they ain’t want me to make it, hell cause I do em all
Through all the trials and tribulations, I stood tall
I had to hang up my cleat’s, pops couldn’t see me ball
You on the outside looking in keep the same energy
Cause you just feeding the monster, keep on motivating me
I swear I need me a sponsor, if only I could be free
I’m bout to grab the game by the neck, hang that shit from a tree
What goes around come around, what’s done to them is done to thy
Middle fingers to my haters I really wish that y’all could see
Come take a walk in my shoes, when Kaepernick took a knee
So many brothers on snooze, a mirror image of me
Like how they say they gon ride, but in the end them niggas flee
And that’s just how the cookie crumbles and to them crumbs imma thief
I ain’t have it when I was growing up
I get outta my element when they showin love
