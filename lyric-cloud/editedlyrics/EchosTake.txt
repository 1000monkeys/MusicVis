If I saw you I would suffocate
My words would just evaporate
And I would run into a dark room
So very far away from you
I know that I would feel defeated
If I looked into your eyes
You're just a character I've painted
Into a script I over analyze

You take what you want
You take what you want

I hate the hue of the dark sun
Reminds me that tomorrow will come
And that I'm nothing but an outline
Searching for fragments of your outline
When you left me on the outside
Thinking I could deal
Your silence held me under
It was impossible to heal

You take what you want
You take what you want
