Yeah, yeah!

When I was younger, wished for girls like you in wishin' wells
But, now I'm older, so my only wish is "wish you well"
Don't know your worth, so love is somethin' that you never felt
And your parents split, so you don't even know if love is real, no
It's Friday night, your local dive got you divin' back in
All these other men around, know they all are practice
Daddy's money, it don't make up for the sense you're lackin'
And you tell your friends you happy, but we know you actin'
You don't know why all you want is emotion
Another night, feelin' empty and broken
A couple things you still needin' to cope with
You're not alone, just know you're not alone

And you've been feelin' hopeless
Now you're lookin' back like you own this, like you own it, own it
You've been feelin' lonely
So you're tellin' me put it on me, put it on me, on me (on me)
You've been sittin' at the bar with eleven of your girls
Girl, I know you'll break my heart, break my heart, yeah
You've been lookin' like my ex, oh, leave her ass on read
I might hit her with the XOXO, don't play

You say you need to change, but you don't change
You been lookin' for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talkin' 'bout you don't play, actin' like you okay
You say you need to change, but you don't change
You been lookin' for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talkin' 'bout you don't play, I don't want it

When I was younger, wished for girls like you in wishin' wells
Well, now I'm older so my only wish is "wish you well"
I hate to say that I relate, I know the pain is real, and
You're feelin' numb, but me, I'm colder than December, feel ya
I put you down like I ain't sittin' at the same bar too
And talk about how you're a hoe, but I play my part too
The DJ put on somethin' for you to play my heart to
And I been lookin' around the room and all I see is you
I don't know how, you still keep your composure
With all the weight that you hold on your shoulders
You're tellin' me, you need me to get closer
You're not alone, to know you're not alone

And you've been feelin' hopeless
Now you're lookin' back like you own this, like you own it, own it (own it)
And you've been feelin' lonely
So you're tellin' me put it on me, put it on me, on me (on me)
And you've been sittin' at the bar with eleven of your girls
Girl, I know you'll break my heart, break my heart, yeah
You've been lookin' like my ex, oh, leave her ass on read
I might hit her with the XOXO, don't play

You say you need to change, but you don't change
You been lookin' for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talkin' 'bout you don't play, actin' like you okay
You say you need to change, but you don't change
You been lookin' for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talkin' 'bout you don't play, I don't want it
