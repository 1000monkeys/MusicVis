Da-dum, da-dum

Be honest
How are you feeling, girlfriend?
Have you been crying again?
Just give it some time, breathe out
See I'm happy that boy was just playing pretend
We said it, you wouldn’t listen
But finally you found out

That he's never gonna love you like we do, oh
But please, he's never gonna find no one like you, no

Girl, just come round mine tonight
I’ve got wine and make-up wipes
I'll hold you, I'll hold you
We can put the kettle on
Talk 'bout how he's not the one
I told you
But I'm never gonna say I told you so

To be honest
His best friend was hotter than him (Yeah)
His jokes were just lacking content (Yeah)
But darling, you're better than
Someone who lies and cheats to set the scene
It's every week and every single club we’ve been in (Oh)
He’s with another girl again
[Pre-Chorus: Perrie & 
All
]
Now you know that he's never gonna love you like we do, yeah
Oh na-na-na-na-na-na, oh na-na-na-na-na-na
Please he’s never gonna find no one like you, oh, no, no, whoa
[Chorus: All, 
Leigh-Anne
 & 
Jesy

Girl, just come round mine tonight
I've got wine and make-up wipes
I'll hold you (
I'll hold you
), I’ll hold you (
I'll hold you
)
We can put the kettle on
Talk 'bout how he's not the one
I told you (
I told you
)
But, I'm never gonna say I told you so
[Bridge: Jade,

I'm never gonna say I told you
 (Yeah)
I'm never gonna say I told you so (Yeah)
I'm never gonna say I warned you
(But I'm just so glad that you know, that you know, that you know)

Girl, just come round mine tonight
I've got wine and make-up wipes
I'll hold you (I'll hold you), I'll hold you (I'll hold you, yeah)
We can put the kettle on
Talk 'bout how he's not the one (He's not the one)
I told you (I told you, no, baby)
But, I'm never gonna say I told you so
Just come round mine tonight (Baby, come around)
I've got wine and make-up wipes
I'll hold you (I'll hold you), I'll hold you (I'll hold you)
We can put the kettle on
Talk 'bout how he's not the one (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I told you
But, I'm never gonna say I told you so, oh
