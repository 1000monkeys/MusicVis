You run away with the love that you gave me
Yes you run away with a smile on your face
Deep inside my head
Is the cave in where I begin
To feel lost without you

Would you rather talk or pour this bottle of bourbon, dear?
â€˜Cause no matter how hard we try the boat wants to sink
Deep inside my head
Is the cave in where I begin
To feel lost without you

Then we walked away
Just to be okay
And we're falling hard
And we're crawling empty
We run away
But there is no place
Now the moon is high
And my soul is empty
We will fade away
But I'm not okay
'Cause the love you gave
The love you gave is lost
Lost

'Cause I'm not dead, but something killed me that night
It hurts to be okay when you are not okay
I'm not okay

Then we walked away
Just to be okay
And we're falling hard
And we're crawling empty
We run away
But there is no place
Now the moon is high
And my soul is empty
We will fade away
But I'm not okay
'Cause the love you gave
The love you gave is lost
Lost
