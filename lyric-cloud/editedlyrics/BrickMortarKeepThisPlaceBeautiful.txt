Try, and promise you will
I will not go if you're still here
The truth is so depressing
I will not go, if you're still here

One day I will be dead, I will be dust, keep this place beautiful
Some day when we grow up, tell them I said, keep this place beautiful
Will you promise me that, promise you will keep this place beautiful?
Some day when we grow up, tell them I said

We could get high, we could get high
We could have all the good things if we just try
Or we could change the world, yeah we could change the world
We could turn all the bad things into good things if we just try
Keep this place beautiful 

Look at you, you're how the wind blows
Remember you know just what the world needs
And we may never know just how the wind blows
Remember you know just what the world needs

We could get high, we could get high
We could have all the good things if we just try
Or we could change the world, yeah we could change the world
We could turn all the bad things into good things if we just try, try, try
Keep this place beautiful 

We could get high, we could get high
We could turn all the good things into bad things if we don't try
Or we could change the world, yeah we could change the world
We could turn all the bad things into good things if we just grow, try
Keep this place beautiful
