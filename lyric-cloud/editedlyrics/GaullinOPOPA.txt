Even in my darkest times you came
Just to see if I'm holding on
This back and forth is driving me insane
Please, just let me go

And I'm making it clear
You're my biggest fear
I'm moving away
There's nothing to say
I know where to go and it's not where I've been

And I'm
Op opa (4x)
And I'm
Op opa (4x)
And I'm making it clear
You're my biggest fear
I'm moving away
There's nothing to say
I know where to go and it's not where I have been

Even in my darkest times you came
Just to see if I'm holding on
This back and forth is driving me insane
Please, just let me go

And I'm making it clear
You're my biggest fear
I'm moving away
There's nothing to say
I know where to go and it's not where I've been

Just let me go
Op opa (4x)
And I'm
Op opa (4x)
And I'm
Op opa (3x)
If I'm holdin'
And I'm
Op opa (3x)
If I'm holdin'
And I'm
If I'm holdin'
And I'm
If I'm holdin'
