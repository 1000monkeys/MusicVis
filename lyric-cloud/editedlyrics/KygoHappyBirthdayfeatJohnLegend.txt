Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came
I've seen in your eyes the dawn of a day
Where nothing will ever be the same

Feel my heart beating through my chest
I'll get used to just saying "yes"
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we began

Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

Wrap you in love for the rest of my days
Pray you find joy through your pain
I can't protect you from every heartbreak
The world isn't easy that way

But I'll be there for you when you crawl
Dad
 will pick you up when you fall
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we began

Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came
