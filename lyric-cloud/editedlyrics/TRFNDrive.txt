I wanna take a ride on your body
All I wanna do with you is a party
A night with you is always freaky
Let‘s take a drive (?) risky
What I want you to do is make me more
I wanna go searching through the unknown
A night with you is always crazy
Let‘s take a ride and let you taste it

Let you taste it, let you taste it
Let you taste it, let you taste, let you taste
Let you taste, let you taste, let you taste
Taste, taste, taste
Taste, taste, let you taste
