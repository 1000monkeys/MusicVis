Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away

Up against the wall now, everybody up against that fucking wall
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
Hold your colour--

Soaking through
Hold your colour

Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away

Up against the wall now, everybody up against that fucking wall
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
Hold your colour--

Soaking through
Hold your colour
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
