A corner office was his dream
More like a prison now it seems
Somewhere on the corporate climb
He left his warrior behind
Now he's just a worker at a daily grind
Steals his years and numbs his mind
His strength is fading, his dreams are blind
This is not the life he had in mind
She lies awake cause he's up all night
Staring at a screen that tells him lies
That the grass is greener on the other side
So shes at the gym fighting off the years
To be young again and calm her fears
That she'll never be enough for him
Just as a young man catches her eye

Now they're trapped in their own worlds
In their own wars
With their cell phones and the closed doors
It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems
But they're all alone together
In the house of their dreams

Little sister
She's a sixteen-year-old princess
Lost somewhere between the swing set
And her brand new crushes chariot awaits
And big brothers rooms glowing with trophies that shout his name
But he'd trade all his high school fame
For some backyard catch with his hero again

So now they're all dressed up in Sunday best
Sit up straight just like the rest
And they sing the songs of peace and rest
That Jesus freely gives
And then their kids look up as daddy stands
And he takes his bride with trembling hands
Brother kneels at his fathers side
As princess looks in the mothers eyes
Their tears tear down the walls as daddy prays
We're trapped in our own worlds
In our own wars
With our cell phones and our closed doors
God only you can save our family
And on this rock we'll build
On this rock we'll build
The house of our dreams
