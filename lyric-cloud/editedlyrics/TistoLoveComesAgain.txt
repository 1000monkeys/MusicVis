You have become
What you have always been
Life figuring out
Peripheral vision
No words we can speak
Our paths have been chosen
But all the trails that we trek
Should lead us back to here
Because our
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
Dig within me
Turn all the secret stones
Forests and fields
Breathing with blood and bones
Still no words we can speak
Our paths have been chosen
But all the trails that we trek
Should lead us back to here
Because our
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
