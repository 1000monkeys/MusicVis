All brawn and no brains, yeah, all those nice things, yeah
You finally got what you want
Someone to look good with and light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see, so

How long will he last before he's a creep in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up again and be my special friend
'Til the end and when will that be?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see, so
I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around
