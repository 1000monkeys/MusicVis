So you were born
In an electrical storm
Took a bite out the sun
Saw your future in a machine built for two
Now your rays
Make me kind of go crazy
Shock and awe and amaze me
Just a ticker tape parade and me

But somethin' was wrong
'Til you tap danced on the air in the night
Screaming at the top of your lungs, you said:

Come on, come on!
Do what you want!
What could go wrong?
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Do what you want!
Oh, come on, come on!
What could go wrong?
Do-Do-Do-Do what you want, yeah!
Come on!
Oh!

Me, I was raised
Amid the trickle-down days
I woke up numb in the haze
And saw my future in a machine built for two
But the light
Gave me some kind of fright
How did wrong get so right?
And lead me stumbling through the dark of night?

Oh, somethin' was wrong
But you tap danced on the air, in the night
Screaming at the top of your lungs, you said:

Come on, come on!
Do what you want!
What could go wrong?
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Do what you want!
Oh, come on, come on!
What could go wrong?
Do-Do-Do-Do what you want, yeah!
Come on!

Do-Do-Do-Do what you want!
Do-Do-Do-Do what you want, yeah!
Alright!
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon…)

Do-Do-Do-Do what you want, yeah!
Do-Do-Do-Do what you want, yeah!
Oh, do what you want!
Hooo!
Do want, do want…
Do what you want!
Do-Do what you want!
Do-Do what you want!
Do-Do what you want!
C-C-C'mon!
C'mon! C'mon!
C'mon! C'mon!
Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do what you want!
Do— Do—
Yeah!
