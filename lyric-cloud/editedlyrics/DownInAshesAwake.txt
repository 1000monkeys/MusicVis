Have to be a drone
Trapped in the silence of my soul
Have to be unknown
Behind every secret that you hold
Give me a sign
Something to live by
While I find my way
You are awake, you are awake
Stop controlling
Let me live my life
You are awake, you are awake
Stop controlling
Leave me to my scars
Have to feel so cold
To blend in and fill the status quo
Must I be a clone
To recover the pieces that you sold
Give me a sign
Something to live by
While I find my way
You are awake, you are awake
Stop controlling
Let me live my life
You are awake, you are awake
Stop controlling
Leave me to my scars
You are awake, you are awake
Somethings calling
Let me live my life
You are awake, you are awake
Stop controlling
Leave me to my scars
Break the cage
Destroy all the things that make you the victim
Bring the rage
Fight fate
