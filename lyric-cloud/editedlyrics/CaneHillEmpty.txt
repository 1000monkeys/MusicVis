If you changed, would I stay?
Don't have an easy answer
A toothache I can't shake
Your misery is comfort
Either way, I'm to blame
You won't change, I can stay

And where'd you go?
The one I used to know
Time is running out, my soul is empty
And where'd you go?
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive

I take back the notes, the melody's cold
My spirit is choked, this isn't my home
When I can breathe, I smell the disease
An ocean created to keep me stuck in between

And where'd you go?
The one I used to know
Time is running out, my soul is empty
And where'd you go?
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive

And where'd you go?
The one I used to know
Time is running out, my soul is empty

And where'd you go?
The one I used to know
Time is running out, my soul is empty
And where'd you go? (And where'd you go?)
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive

And where'd you go? (And where did you go?)
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive
