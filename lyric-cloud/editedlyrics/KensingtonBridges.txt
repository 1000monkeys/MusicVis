Yet another unstable weekend
We bought our own praise with easy goals
And we're off to sell it as the greatest story told
Yet another ungraceful evening
Another man's faith, an easy foe
And we're off to shiver in the face of the unknown

Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold

Yet another ungrateful weekday
We're caught in a game where the winner takes all
And we're off to tell it as the greatest story told

Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold
Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold

We got carried away by it
We got carried away from home
We got carried away by it
We got carried away from home

Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold
Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold

We got carried away by it
We got carried away from home
We got carried away by it
We got carried away from home
