One, two

Sometimes I wish I were dead and gone
I'm a fool in your eyes
I'm a fool for the vibes
Like my lips, you can read all about it
Smell all about it, it won't leave me alone
I sit my ass on this rollercoaster
I get my blisters from time to time
I sit my ass on this rollercoaster
I get my blisters from time to time

I wanna see the world inside your mind
I wanna see it through it your eyes
I had a dream about it last night and the night before

Sometimes I wish I were dead and gone
I'm a fool in your eyes
I'm a fool for the vibes
Getting closer, fire back on my tongue
When you smell all about it, it won't be alone

I wanna see the world inside your mind
I wanna see it through it your eyes
I had a dream about it last night and the night before

Look who has decided after all this time
It's nice to slip and let yourself fall
We're weak on the knees
We let ourselves believe
Weak on the knees
Look who has decided after all this time
It's nice to slip and let yourself fall
We're weak on the knees
We let ourselves believe
Weak on the knees
