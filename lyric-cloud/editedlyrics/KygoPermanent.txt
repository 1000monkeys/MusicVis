You just, you made it look easy
It's like you didn't feel it
Not like I do
I followed, I followed the pieces
I tried to receive it
To when it was new

Wanna get out, wanna feel like somebody
But nothing else ever feels like your body
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
I drive the streets where you told me your secrets
We made mistakes, but we both didn't mean it
And we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent

I'll bet, I'll bet you're in Soho
Dancing in slow-mo
With someone new, oh
I can't lie, I, I hope you'll never forget it
And that you still wear it
Like all your tattoos

Wanna get out, wanna feel like somebody
But nothing else ever feels like your body
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
I drive the streets where you told me your secrets
We made mistakes, but we both we didn't mean it
And we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent

Permanent
Permanent
Permanent
For a moment there
It was permanent
