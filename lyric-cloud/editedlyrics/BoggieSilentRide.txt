Out of sight, look, uh, out of mind, yeah, uh
I can't lie, I'm detached, I need guidance, uh
I've been dyin', uh, I've been fighting, uh
Got this voice in my mind, won't be quiet
Silent ride home, silent ride
Silent ride home, silent ride
Silent ride home

I got all these voices in my head (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Got too many bitches in my bed (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
I don't store they numbers, just instead
I start scrolling through the texts and look for pictures in the thread (Mmm)
I'm on your head, you're only banging 'cause of streaming, ain't ya? (Ain't ya?)
You're only gang when it's convenient, ain't ya? (Ain't ya?)
Ignore the grades from every teacher
I was throwing up the B while I was trying to get Jamesha
Who am I? (Ooh)

Out of mind, yeah, uh
I can't lie, I'm detached, I need guidance, uh
I've been dyin', uh, I've been fighting, uh
Got this voice in my mind, won't be quiet
Silent ride home, silent ride
Silent ride home, silent ride
Silent ride home

I love to lie, I'm extra'd out
I know I'm wrong but let me slide, uh (Let me slide)
If I ain't right before I rise
Tell the world I'm dead inside, uh (Dead inside)
The ride was long, I slept for five
She got my phone, I'm petrified
She read my text, I read her mind
Pressing time and dead my high
Connect to lies, express your mind
I wish you'd talk more, know that that's a lost war
She gon' take the aux cord, and let her play her thoughts for her
She gon' play them throwbacks and hold back, pretend to be lit
No cap, I need a energy shift

Out of sight, look, uh, out of mind, yeah, uh
I can't lie, I'm detached, I need guidance, uh
I've been dyin', uh, I've been fighting, uh
Got this voice in my mind, won't be quiet
Silent ride home, silent ride
Silent ride home, silent ride
Silent ride home
