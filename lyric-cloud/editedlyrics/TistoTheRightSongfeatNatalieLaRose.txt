Feel it in my bones
This anticipation
See him through the smoke
So hard to be patient

There is a clock in mind
We're running out of time
Killing, it oh so easily
I wanna feel him breathe
I want his hands on me
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
Just one thing I need, I need, I need, I need
(Bass, bass, bass, bass)

Alright, come on, hit me with the right song
I've been waiting for it all night baby
Before they turn the lights on, yeah
Come on, hit me with the right song
When it plays run that bass through my veins
Come and take me away, take me away
Alright, come on, hit me with the right song
Come on, hit me with the right song

Don't know where this goes
I let the wind take me
Into the unknown
No more hesitating

There is a clock with mine
We're running out of time
Killing, it goes so easily
I wanna feel him breathe
I want his hands on me
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
You know there's just one thing I need
Just one thing I need, I need, I need, I need
(Bass, bass, bass, bass)

Alright, come on, hit me with the right song
I've been waiting for it all night baby
Before they turn the lights on, yeah
Come on, hit me with the right song
When it plays run that bass through my veins
Come and take me away, take me away
Alright, come on, hit me with the right song
Come on, hit me with the right song
