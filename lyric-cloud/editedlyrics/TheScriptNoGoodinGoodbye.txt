All the things that we have lost
Breaking up comes at a cost
I know I'll miss this mistake
Every word I try to choose
Either way I’m gonna lose
Can’t take the ache from heartbreak

But as you walk away
You don’t hear me say

Where’s the "good" in "goodbye"?
Where’s the "nice" in "nice try"?
Where’s the "us" in "trust" gone?
Where’s the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now I’m the "low" in "lonely"
‘Cause I don’t own you only
I can take this mistake but
I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break"
No, I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break"

No matter how it falls apart
There’s an “art” in "breaking hearts"
But there’s no “fair” in "farewell"
And when I see you in the street
I pray to God you don’t see
The silent "hell" in "I wish you well"

But as you walk away
You don’t hear me say

Where’s the "good" in "goodbye"?
Where’s the "nice" in "nice try"?
Where’s the "us" in "trust" gone?
Where’s the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now I’m the "low" in "lonely"
‘Cause I don’t own you only
I can take this mistake but
I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break"
I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break"
I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break"
I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break"
(I can’t take the "ache" from "heart break")

If I could turn back time
Then I would rewrite those lines
If I could turn back time
Then I would rewrite those lines
If I could turn back time
I would rewrite those lines
If I could turn back time
I would rewrite those lines, lines, lines
