We're burning at the stake now
Our angels from a far
Have come to live in ghost towns
Their tombs were black and charred
I've seen the messengers
But they were not for me
They said we're black witches
Parts of an industry
War - this is what it sounds like
War - cries unsynchronized
War - this is what it sounds like
War - to keep us terrified
We keep the cameras rolling
So we can televise
All that we've been controlling
To keep you mesmerized
Why could the right explosions
Just like celebrities
Commercialize religions
And their inequities
War - this is what it sounds like
War - cries unsynchronized
War - this is what it sounds like
War - to keep us terrified
War - this is what it sounds like
War - cries unsynchronized
War - this is what it sounds like
War - to keep us terrified
War - this is what it sounds like
War - cries unsynchronized
War - this is what it sounds like
War - to keep us terrified
