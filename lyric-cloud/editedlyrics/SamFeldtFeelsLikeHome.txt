What if we could wake up in a dream?
Moonlight spilling over everything

This summer's saving, saving all of us
We start a fire, fire, just for us
Our hearts are screaming, bursting and bleeding
Beating as one

Take the moments, stop the time
We're in a California state of mind
And it's been too long, but you're not alone
And it feels like home
On a night like tonight
No one's wondering why it feels like home
Feels just like home
Feels just like home
Feels just like home

What if everyone was running wild?
Swim across the ocean, meet the sky

The waves are breaking, breaking just for us
Colours are dancing, dancing over us
Our hearts are screaming, bursting and bleeding
Beating as one

Take the moments, stop the time
We're in a California state of mind
And it's been too long, but you're not alone
And it feels like home
On a night like tonight
No one's wondering why it feels like home
Feels just like home
Feels just like home
Feels just like home
