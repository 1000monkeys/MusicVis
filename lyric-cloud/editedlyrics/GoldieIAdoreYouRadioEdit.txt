(Verse One)
Breathing the air
And you feeling ma’ decadence
Gorgeous and fair
So I’m feeling her reverence
What you gonn’ do with this pearl?
Cutting up, down in my world
Preceding her care
So I wonder what balance is
Focused all year
She deserving the palaces
Consuming the bachelors
Deep in they world, Yeah
And I’m watching the flaws
And your feelings are trapped by the door
To the girls I adore
Still breaking the laws
And I’m healing from whores
Need a vacation next to the shore
Would you come through?
Colour water and fellatio
In that order, with carpaccio
Doing rounds for the radio
Swim in my poetry, knowing we drastic
I promise I never go flaccid
You drown in my acid, no reaching exit
I’m feeling like tilting my exes
I noticed you passed it
Still wanna fuck you
While you wearing your glasses
I got it bad bad, burn me to ashes
Now feel the dab dab, orgasm it crashes
We reaching the Autumn to fall
Never pass a nigga, here till we fall
She wonders why I never call
Still wanna hit it, just take off your drawers
I noticed you fathom my ways
While I’m paralysed in my sleep, silenced to pray
The colder the weather, the less that I say
Though I never get drowned in my shame
(Hook)
My blowing mind, visualizing signs
I’m living life, tryina’ get too high
I wanna get too high, alone
Cause I know, I’m finna die alone
I’m on the grind, my paths are intertwined
Just hear the chimes, when the stars aligned
I’m feeling colourblind and slow
I wanna do headlines in shows

(Verse Two)
Story telling just to get you jealous
Wanna get me back
I know I’m on a role
Flower grows from the concrete
Everything we doing obsolete
9-11, never try to sell us
Stab us from the back
You tryina’ get a role
Power woes that are so deep
All the children tryina take the lead
Loving the matrix
We tryina’ get acres
Not really concerned with our maker
Glowing on phases
In all different places
We tryina’ make burn in Jamaica
A house full of vases
With two different faces
Polygamy yearns just to cater
The gorgeous oasis
And lingerie laces
I wanna fuck you on the basin
You feeling so heavy on basis
You tryina’ update a new status
I’m hoping the girls would just chase us
We thirsting for money, that’s deep in a crater
Attached to the flows
And a fuck you to traitors
We don’t really owe you a favour
Attached to the flows
And a fuck you to traitors
We don’t really owe you a favour
We reaching the Autumn to fall
Never pass a nigga, here till we fall
She wonders why I never call
Still wanna hit it, just take off your drawers
I noticed you fathom my ways
While I’m paralysed in my sleep, silenced to pray
The colder the weather, the less that I say
Though I never get drowned in my shame
(Hook)
My blowing mind, visualizing signs
I’m living life, tryina’ get too high
I wanna get too high, alone
Cause I know, I’m finna die alone
I’m on the grind, my paths are intertwined
Just hear the chimes, when the stars aligned
I’m feeling colourblind and slow
I wanna do headlines in shows
(Verse Three)
Covertly life is just scandalous
Growing more hate
Every time when they panning us
Perfectly down like a challenger
Tryina set dates
But I’m burning my calendar
Tryina’ get shoes that are lavender
I’m fucking hating the examiners
Setting some papers like they wanna banish us
Next to a devil parameter
A lot of stories that I’ll never tell
Lesser glory we forever fell
Thinking I’m not really human
Simply cause I never really felt
Really got dumped in the closest hell
Baptism by fire, like Anabelle
It’s silly I’m numb and I never held
All the warmth from my baby well
Most of you won’t really notice shit
Cause I know how to keep my mouth shut
Golden view I really grew this shit
The Nile flows, love inside the heart
A young nigga, feeling so apart
Tryina make it Goldie Goldie, art
Grizzly hating people voicing they opinions
I don’t get it but they never spark
We reaching the Autumn to fall
Never pass a nigga, here till we fall
She wonders why I never call
Still wanna hit it, just take off your drawers
I noticed you fathom my ways
While I’m paralysed in my sleep, silenced to pray
The colder the weather, the less that I say
Though I never get drowned in my shame
