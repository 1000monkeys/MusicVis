Who's gonna stop me when there's no one there to stop me but me?
A copy of a copy of a hero that you want me to be (To be, to be)
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
We're all just lookin' for freedom
They called off the rescue party, ain't nobody lookin' for me

Never make excuses 'cause they never made excuses my size
Run, baby, run, that's real hunger not love in my eyes
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
We're all just lookin' for freedom
I got an appetite for livin' but this life is gonna eat me alive

We're all just lookin' for freedom
We're running straight to the demons
We're all just lookin' for freedom
We're running straight to the demons
We're all just
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences

Who's gonna stop me when there's no one there to stop me but me?
Who's gonna stop me when there's no one there to stop me but me?
We're all just sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
Sneaking out, jumping over backyard fences
We're all just lookin' for freedom
Who is gonna stop me?
Who is gonna stop me?
Who's gonna stop me but me?

Too high, too high
Gravity don't work anymore

Too high, too high
Gravity don't work anymore
(Gravity don't work anymore)
Too high, too high
Gravity don't work anymore
(Gravity don't work anymore)
Too high, too high
Gravity don't work anymore
(Gravity don't work anymore)
