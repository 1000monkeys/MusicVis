Oh please, don't go, I need you
I'll please you, not mislead you
If you would be my only one
Together we move slowly
I'll never leave you lonely
If you would be my only one

If you believe
We were meant to be
Why'd you leave me alone?

What happened to forever?
I'll try to make things better
If you would be my only one
Now six days since we've spoken
I'll fix you when you're broken
If you would be my only one

If you believe
We were meant to be
Why'd you leave me alone?
If you believe
We were meant to be
Why'd you leave me alone?

If you love me too
Can I call you?
My Only One
If you say no
I won't let go
My Only One

If you believe
We were meant to be
Why'd you leave me alone?
If you believe
We were meant to be
Why'd you leave me alone?
