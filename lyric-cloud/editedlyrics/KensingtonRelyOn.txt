So that I'm beating the odds
And I'm running all the races won't solve
A fear that is causing the harm to overtake
I'm rather be on the end of freedom, I'll seek it

But I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on
Yeah I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on

Hold onto a reason to stall but we've gone through all the phases
I hoped to open it all but you guard my only gate, my enemy
On the edge of leaving all we had for better days
You can't compete with my demons

But I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on
Yeah I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on

We will go it on our own
High hopes for the road to come
We will go it on our own
High hopes that we'll get there
We will go it on our own
High hopes

But I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on
Yeah I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on
Yeah I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on
Yeah I've got to have you
To rely on
To rely on
