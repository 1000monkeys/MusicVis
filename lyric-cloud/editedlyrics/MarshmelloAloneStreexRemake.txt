I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you

Trying to find my way back home to you
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Trying to find my way back home to you

I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you

Trying to find my way back home to you
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na
Trying to find my way back home to you
