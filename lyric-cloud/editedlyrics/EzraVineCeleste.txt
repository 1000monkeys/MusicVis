I was sitting in a field of pine trees
Coaxing the words from the earth and the dirt and
I sought a muse but the words just wouldn’t come
It’s been a while since I saw you at New Year
Holding your breath, your eyes upon the second hand
The way you looked is still vivid to me

You’re something out of a dream
Messing with my head
And I've been looking for you
Are you hiding?
’Cause I like the way you’re calling to me
Your spell upon me
You’re something out of a dream
And I like it, though I fight it

It took a while for the medicine to sink in
Blow out the fog and remove all the cobwebs
Now I’m clear I can hear myself think straight
I’m on the road with my clothes in a rucksack
Over my shoulder following the whispers
People ask me where I’m going in such haste
And I say

My girl’s a switchblade
A bright light on the cityscape
Wherever she goes I’m gonna chase

You’re something out of a dream
Messing with my head
And I've been looking for you
Are you hiding?
’Cause I like the way you’re calling to me
Your spell upon me
You’re something out of a dream
And I like it, though I fight it

You're something out of a dream
You're something out of a dream
Woo-ooh-ooh
