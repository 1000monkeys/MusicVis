Now in comes di ting called
Major Lazer number one sound inna dancehall
We stand tall, soundboy diss and fall
That's all, brr

We ready fi di war
I can see di fear in a ya eyes, I can smell the desperation
But we have dubplates galore
Major Lazer sound, yes a we rule the nation
Tonight a little 
drum pan
 will die
Soundboy

And it no really matter what you try

Stiggy-diggy-diggy-don
Well reggae music a di peoples' choice
Use this rhythm and make your sound play nice

A Major Lazer
A knock down di place
Now di time to test out di bass
Now make it roll, roll, roll, roll, roll...
Now make it, now make it

Stiggy-diggy-diggy-don
