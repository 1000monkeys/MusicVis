Some now the best arrived
Some now the best are home
Don't, don't, don't, don't you want it
Don't, don't, don't, don't you won't
And when the blast arrived
Don't be the last to fall
Don't, don't, don't, don't you want it

So, so you want me gone
You want me come back now
You know we can't stop right here
We can't stop right here
So no, I won't be coming out
Oh, yeah, you cast it right there
We can't stop right here now
Oh-oh, I'm done with it
Oh-oh, I'm done with it
Oh-oh, I'm done with it
Oh-oh, I'm done with it

So now the best for last
Don't want the rest to know
Done, done, done what you wanted
Done, done, done what you want
Now we're the last to rise
Now we're the last to go
Done, done, don't do, want it

So, so you want me gone
You want me come back now
You know we can't stop right here
We can't stop right here
So no, I won't be coming out
Oh yeah, you cast it right there
We can't stop right here now

Not by your win, your window
Not by your win, your eye
Hopin' again you'll arrive
And oh-oh I feel sight
Not by your win, your win though
Not by your win, you're high
You cast it right there
You can't stop right here now

Oh-oh I'm done with it
Oh-oh I'm done with it
You want it all (e-he)
You want it all (e-he)
You want it all (e-he)
You want it all (e-he)
You want it all (e-he)
You wanted it so
You wanted it all (e-he)
You wanted it so
You wanted it all (e-he)
You wanted it so
You want it all (e-he)
You wanted it so

So, you want me gone
You want me come back now
You know we can't stop right here
We can't stop right here
So no, I won't be coming out
Yeah, you cast it right there
We can't stop right here now

Not by your win, your win though
Not by your win, you're high
Oh but again you ride
Oh-oh I'm so sight
Not by your win, your win though
Not by your win, you're high
You cast it right there
We can't stop right here now

Oh-oh I'm done with it
Oh-oh I'm done with it
Oh-oh I'm done with it
Oh-oh I'm done with it
