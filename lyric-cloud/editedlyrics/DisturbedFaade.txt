No one knows
Just what has become of her
Shattered doll, desperate
Oh, so innocent and delicate
But too damn obdurate and obstinate to let go
Broken down, hurt again
It never ends
Frightened and trembling
Did she fall again, an "accident"?
Her eyes encircled in black again
I can't believe that she's still with him

For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
Your façade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery

Look inside
See what has become of her
Hiding within again
Can she pick herself up again?
It's just too difficult and arduous to let go
Homicide flashes through her mind again
No more pain; take control
If he raises his hand again
She'll find her freedom in killing him
The world will see that she's had enough

For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
Your façade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery
For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
From the look in your eyes
I know you bleed internally

For how long you deny?
How long until you walk away?
Your façade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery
For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
From the look in your eyes
I know you bleed internally

Broken down, hurt again
It never ends
