You might not think you're a supermodel
But you look like one to me
I'd rather have your picture on my phone
Than on the cover of a magazine
It's hard to think that a girl like you
Could have any insecurities
It's funny how all the things you would change
Are all things that are cute to me
And I know you don't believe me
And you think that I'm a fool
But I don't care

Maybe
You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You're perfectly perfect to me

You brush it off every time I tell you
Your smile lights up the room
And I'm guessing that you don't even notice
That the whole world notices you
You think you're clumsy, I think you're cool
You say you're typical, but I think you rule
Sometimes I wonder if you'll ever believe
That I wrote this song for you

Maybe
You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You're perfectly perfect
Someday
You're gonna see you're beautiful this way
And that you're always gonna make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You’re perfectly perfect to me

You don't have to try
Change a single thing
'Cause just the way you are is sweeter than anything
Maybe I’m a fool, but it’s always been you
‘Cause no one ever makes me smile the way you do

Maybe
You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You're perfectly perfect
Someday
You're gonna see you're beautiful this way
And that you're always gonna make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You’re perfectly perfect to me

(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh) Yeah
You're perfectly perfect to me
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
You're perfectly perfect to me
