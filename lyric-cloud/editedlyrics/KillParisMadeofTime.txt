Wherever you are, I know you're far
You could be miles and miles away
You know I will wait
Funny how home is a voice on the phone
Telling me, "Don't worry
'Cause you know I will wait"

'Cause you know I'm made of time for you
You know I'm made of time
Gonna be right here waitin'
Gonna be right here waitin'
'Cause you know I'm made of time for you
You know I'm made of time
Gonna be right here waitin'
Gonna be right here waitin'
For you
Oh, oh
For you
Oh, oh

Just 'cause I'm far, you still got my heart
And I know I'm miles and miles away
But I know you would wait
Funny how home is a voice on the phone
Telling me, "Don't worry
'Cause you know I will wait"

You know I'm made of time for you
You know I'm made of time
And I'll be right here waitin' (right here waitin')
Right here waitin'
You know I'm made of time for you
You know I'm made of time
And I'll be right here waiting (right here waitin')
Right here waitin'
For you
Oh, oh
For you
Oh, oh

Wanna be right here next to you
Right here next to you, next to you
Wanna be right here next to you
Right here next to you, next to you
Yeah I wanna be
