Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it

My limbs are weak from trying to reach you, oh
My body moves in languages only you can speak in
My heart aches for your touch when I'm sleeping, oh
I feel you move in distances worth keeping

Is it that you can't hear me clearly?
I thought that I might matter dearly
So why won't you say it, just say it, say it
And take me out of my own head?
Is it that you can't hear me clearly?
I thought that I might matter dearly
So why won't you say it, just say it, say it
And take me out of my own head?
Out of my own head

(Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it)

I couldn't be on your mind like I needed, oh
Illusive eyes kept pulling me into your illusion
My mind aches for your lust when I'm sleeping, oh
You always leave in distances worth keeping

Is it that you can't hear me clearly?
I thought that I might matter dearly
So why won't you say it, just say it, say it
And take me out of my own head?
Is it that you can't hear me clearly?
I thought that I might matter dearly
So why won't you say it, just say it, say it
And take me out of my own head?

You say your eyes fill with fear when I come around
I'm not a ghost, I've got bones breathing underground
Ringing in your head
I'm in your mind
You say your eyes fill with fear when I come around
I'm not a ghost, I've got bones breathing underground
You say your eyes fill with fear when I come around
I'm not a ghost, I've got bones breathing underground
Ringing in your head

Is it that you can't hear me clearly?
I thought that I might matter dearly
So why won't you say it, just say it, say it
And take me out of my own head?
Is it that you can't hear me clearly?
I thought that I might matter dearly
So why won't you say it, just say it, say it
And take me out of my own head?
Out of my own head

(Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it
Say it, just say it, say it)
