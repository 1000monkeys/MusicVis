Girl You Stank (take a bath)(x16)

Now I remember one day when I was walkin down the street
Me and my nigga Soulja Boy seen four fine freaks
I walked up to em' an asked them what it be
They said lets go cause we down for the G's
I took em' to the crib and rolled a blunt of dro
I said yall down to freak they said you already know
Took one of in the room an pulled down her pants
Turned on some tunes then she said she wanna dance
But then she start to sweat, her body getting wet
Her arms got musty and it smelt like shit
I said oh no its time for me to go
Girl you stank(take a bath) please put back on ya clothes

Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em

Well let me tell you how it was, we chillin at the club
Me and my nigga Lil Rap lookin clean posted up
The girl walked up I said shawty wats ya name
Then she opened up her mouth she's a doo doo head mayne
She's a doo doo head and you already know wats up
Sippin on some sizzurp you need some Listerine up in yo cup
That ain't even the worst part I said let me try it out
Hopped up in the Chevy sittin heavy now we ridin out

Girl pull yo pants up you smell just like a garbage can
