I've been calling, I've got endless reasons
Wait now, hold on
Say you still believe we run straight through fire
But we can do better, we can do better
Save our lost time, cause we can do better, we can do better

Cause all that we need is a second to hold on
Cause we are the strong ones
All that we need is a reason to fight on
Cause we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones, we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones (Strong ones)
We run straight through fire
But we can do better, we can do better
Save our lost time, cause we can do better

Cause all that we need is a second to hold on
Cause we are the strong ones
All that we need is a reason to fight on
Cause we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones, we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones
We are the strong ones
We are the strong ones
We are the strong ones (Strong ones)
We are the strong ones (Strong ones, strong ones, strong ones...)
