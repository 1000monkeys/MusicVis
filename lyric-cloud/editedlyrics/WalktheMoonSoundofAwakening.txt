The sound of awakening
The virgin yawn of folded wings that cracks the crust of the cocoon
The breaking of first light inside the womb
Do you feel my heartbeat quickening
In between the baited breaths before the turning of the page
The sense that everything is about to change
Kicking and screaming you can't make me leave this place
Cradled in the arms of darkness I am safe
Until you pulled me into life, how could I know that I'd been blind
It was love at first sight, when I opened my new eyes and saw your face

The sound of awakening
The exoskeleton thickening
Do you feel the floodgates opening
To the sound of awakening
As whispers in the heart disclose the rumors of the truth
When the mind has all but hidden it from view
The surface trembles as the core begins to heat
And you no longer trust the turning earth beneath your feet
Questioning if time has ever moved in a straight line
When you hear the aches of past life lovers
 as you pass by one another in the street

It's the sound of awakening
The psychotropical symphony
All the voices washing over me
The distance
And the difference
Between us
Is just illusion
It's all a dream
It's always been a dream
It's all one magnificent dream
And that's all it's ever been
(even though)
It's all a dream
(even though)
It's always been a dream
(even though)
Itâ€™s all a dream
My love for you will echo in eternity
The distance
And the difference
Between us
Is just illusion
