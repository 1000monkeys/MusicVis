I can take a beating like a good pair of headphones
I can take a hit like Karate Kid
You know, you can learn a lot from a good pair of headphones
Like how to take a beating
I know I did

It's just another chain reaction
When you make the big mistake
Suffer all the satisfaction
Of feeling this way

A pretty picture of a better man taking you out
Holding your hand at your favorite band
He says, "You're so fucking cute when you're rockin it out"
And you laugh till you're out, out of breath, CPR, mouth to mouth

It's just another chain reaction
When you make the big mistake
Suffer all the satisfaction
Of learning something

(I'm so glad we can still be friends)

I can take a beating like a good pair of headphones
And I can stand the test of time like Harrison Ford
So go ahead, rough me up like a good pair of headphones
I wanna open my heart but you won't open the door
Why, why
Why i gotta feel this way?
