I rode a grey horse, a mule roany mare
Grey mane and grey tail, a green stripe down her back
Grey mane and grey tail, a green stripe down her back
There wasn't a hair on her
Be-what was coal black

She stood so still, she threw me to the dirt
She bruised my heart and bruised my shirt
From stirrup to saddle I mounted again
And on my ten toes I rode over the plain

In Nottamun town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
To show me the way
To Nottamun town
(To Nottamun town)

Met the King and the Queen and a company more
A-marching behind and a-marching before
Came a stark-naked drummer a-beating a drum
With his hands in his pocket come marching along
To Nottamun town

In Nottamun town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
To show me the way
To Nottamun town
To Nottamun town
To Nottamun town
Ohhh ohh
Ohhh ohh
In Nottamun town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
To show me the way
Ohhh
