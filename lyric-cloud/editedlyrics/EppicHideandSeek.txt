Now are we
Gonna continue playing this little game of hide and seek?
'Cause it looks like the only two playing are you and me

Now these days my heart's been real heavy
Can say they've not been tampered
You brought out the worst in me
I'm nervous, then I'm in this God forsaken place I'm anxious
I'm looking behind to see I'm being followed by ravens
From a distance, I notice the devil in you, as he waves
Laughing at me, yes this is bloody Mary she shot her mace
Being swallowed by the telly truth and away gain
The John Wilkes Booth to my Abraham Lincoln
Had a nightmare foreshadowing assassination
One of those being mine you made that pretty blatant
Caught you wondering in the woods as you were slaughtering angels
One by one as you headed home with their halos
Yes, this, this ungodly torrential rain that possesses you when you're allowing it to transcend
I better recognized your touch
There isn't anything more to discuss, I'm saying murder me if you must

Now are we
Gonna continue playing this little game of hide and seek?
'Cause it looks like the only two playing are you and me
Now are we

Staring directly at me; the demon you worship
I read the letter you wrote me, I'm apprehensive it's imminent
It's me you want isn't it, you're so desperately after?
Or how you murdered your psychiatrist and your pastor
As my blood stains that leaves the bottom
Staining the last roses so innocent that will ever blossom
Rejoice in my absence as you bask in the malice
I'm praying you at least see god in my evanescence
You're beginning to succumb to the rhythm of the grim reaper snare drum
I swear some of those ravens were once dust
You found a place of haven with harps and violins
At a payphone between hell and heaven but wasn't calling no Jesus
Serious
Remove me from existence
Will be like no one's missing once I trigger the 6th sense of your senses
Uh yeah, with a land I'd like to minister
I wanna remain there like an everlasting whisper

Now are we
Gonna continue playing this little game of hide and seek?
'Cause it looks like the only two playing are you and me
Now are we
Gonna continue playing this little game of hide and seek?
'Cause it looks like the only two playing are you and me

I solemnly swear I solemnly
Swear that you were
In my prayers that you
Were in my prayers I, I
Solemnly swear I solemnly
Swear that you were in my prayers
That you were in my prayers

Now are we
Gonna continue playing this little game of hide and seek?
'Cause it looks like the only two playing are you and me
Now are we
Gonna continue playing this little game of hide and seek?
