Good morning Orono, you are awake
The weather today is dark
Would you like to get up?
Or perhaps, do nothing, nothing
(It is not an easy one)

Scream, I just had a dream
Where my friends all dissolved away
Breathe, it's all reality
I'm 17, still not over that dream

We know you feel the world is too heavy
But you can turn it all around if you want
Oh yes, you're in charge of what you feel
And when your life is looking real grim it's time to scream it out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

It's all good
(You tell yourself)
It's all good
(느낌이 어떤가요?)
It's all good
(How does it feel?)
It's all, it's all
It's all, it's good

Hi, this is Anthony Robbins
I wanna take a moment before we get started just to thank you for the privilege and the opportunity to share with you the strategies and techniques that have positively shaped my life

Run, I've had it up to here
Gotta get out and do all of my chores
Hold up, it's only 3 p.m
I ought to go back and relax some more

We know you feel the world is too heavy
But you can turn it all around if you want
Oh yes, you're in charge of what you feel
And when your life is looking real grim it's time to scream it out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

It's all good
(You tell yourself)
It's all good
(느낌이 어떤가요?)
It's all good
(How does it feel?)
It's all, it's all
It's all, it's

(Congratulations)
Good
