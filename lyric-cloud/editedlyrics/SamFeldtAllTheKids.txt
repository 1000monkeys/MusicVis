Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Take a little time
You gotta save the other side
All the kids are lost
And running wild

But they say
Oh oh oh oh oh
They say the opposite
Say the opposite
Oh oh oh oh oh
They say the opposite
Say the opposite


Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Take a little time
You gotta save the other side
All the kids are lost
And running wild

But they say
Oh oh oh oh oh
They say the opposite
Say the opposite
Oh oh oh oh oh
They say the opposite
Say the opposite
Oh oh oh oh oh
They say the opposite
Say the opposite
Oh oh oh oh oh
But all the kids are fine


Oh oh oh oh oh
They say the opposite
Say the opposite
Oh oh oh oh oh
But all the kids are fine
But all the kids are fine
