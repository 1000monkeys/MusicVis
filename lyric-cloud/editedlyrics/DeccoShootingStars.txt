Because we are, we are the shooting stars!
I am the light in the dark
There everyone, if you there is a sun!
From outerspace above to your hearts
When you hold your head up high!
You look up into the night!
I'm falling out of the sky! (I'm falling out of the sky)
Cause we are shooting stars
Light it up be who you are
Cause we are shooting stars
Light it up be who you are (who you are oh!)

Burn in the sky with love like the dark from above
Hear the sound of our voices the world recognize us!
It's time that we rise up (Oh yeah!)
It's time that we get down
Burst in flames
Don't it look cool as we head twards the ground!

Hear the sound of the whole crowd
Make the decloration out loud
It's the celebration of who we are
Not to change all of our flaws
Not to change to bein' perfect
But we are more than worth it
We gon' have the time of our life
Dancin' under the moon tonight!

When you hold your head up high!
And look up into the night!
We're falling out of the sky
We're here to light up the night
Cause we are shooting stars!
Light it up!
Be who you are
Cause we are shooting stars!
Light it up
Be who you are
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're shooting stars
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're shooting stars (be who you are!)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're shooting stars
Be who you are!
We're shooting stars (You are the star)
Be who you are
We're shooting stars (Stars)
Be who you are (who you are)
