I let you in, into my world
I gave you things you said you deserved

But you took all I had, threw it back in my face
At the hardest time, worst possible place
I know that I was not to blame

So go ahead and take everything
When it's over I'll still be standing
Because I was here from the start
You won the war, but still you lost my heart

In all my plans, you followed me
You crossed your heart and said you believed

But you took all I had, threw it back in my face
At the hardest time, worst possible place
I know that I was not to blame

So go ahead and take everything
When it's over I'll still be standing
Because I was here from the start
You won the war, but still you lost my heart
