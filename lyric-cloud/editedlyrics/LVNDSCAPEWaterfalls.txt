You had it all
And you make it back there after all
I'll pick you up
When you are down and about to fall
Life might seem wrong
But this won't be lasting for too long
Gotta be strong
And have trust in all these dreams that you've been praying for


Do you ever
Wonder if the star shine out for you
I will never
Turn my back on our truth
On days of doubt
I would listen to you as a friend
Hope let you down
We'll take the future in our hands and walk it again


I'll be your raincoat, on high tide your sailboat
When the water falls from your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
And when the night comes, I'll be your light house
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes

I'll be your raincoat, on high tide your sailboat
When the water falls from your eyes
And when the night comes, I'll be your light house
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
