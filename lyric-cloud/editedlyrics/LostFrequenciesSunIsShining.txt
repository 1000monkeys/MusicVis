Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
The sun is shining, shining down
Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
I'm alive and I'm feeling, feeling fine
How many more days can you hold out
"How much longer can you wait?" she asked
There was a time I thought I, I could answer
But my tongue gets tied as my thoughts drift away
Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
The sun is shining, shining down
Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
I'm alive and I'm feeling, feeling fine
And I'm feeling, feeling fine
How many more days
I'm alive and I'm feeling, feeling fine
Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
I'm alive and I'm feeling, feeling fine
