Verse 1:
I need to let you now
This time I will be gone
I will be better off without you, without you
Lost in a desert storm
I wish I known before
I will be better off without you, without you
Pre-Chorus:
I've got my reasons
I'm not coming back
You tell me to wait, but i'm better than that
Trapped in this puzzle
I'm fading away
You tell me to wait
But what you going to do about it
Chorus:
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it
Verse 2:
Maybe i'm acting cold
Don't want to lose control
I will be better off without you, without you
Why do I move so slow
Gave up this long ago
I will be better off without you, without you
Pre-Chorus:
I've got my reasons
I'm not coming back
You tell me to wait, but i'm better than that
Trapped in this puzzle
I'm fading away
You tell me to wait
But what you going to do about it
Chorus:
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it
What you going to do about it x17
