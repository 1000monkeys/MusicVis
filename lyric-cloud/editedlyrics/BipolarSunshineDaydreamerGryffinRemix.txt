Victory, may lay in the fog
Silent seas, howling dogs
You and me, cut from a different cloth
Concrete love, oh let me tell ya
And I'm gonna take this one step further
And let's explore, don't stick to who we know
We're gonna take this one step further
I've found the truth, the stars are you
So daydreamer, riding the dark
Skiing in the fields, oh let's get lost
Buy a ticket to Mars, oh show me the way
And I’m sure I’ll stay (x10)
We're blossom leaves, no camouflage
Let colors bleed for us all to see
Hey! You're coming with me
Whether you like it or not
1, 2, 3!
And I'm gonna take this one step further
And let's explore, don't stick to who you know
We're gonna take this one step further
I've found the truth, the stars are you
So daydreamer, riding the dark
Skiing in the fields, oh let's get lost
Buy a ticket to Mars, oh show me the way
And I’m sure I’ll stay (x10)
