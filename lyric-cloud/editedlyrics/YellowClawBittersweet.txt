Sweeter than the berry
I know you want the juice
Suckin' on that cherry
Biting too
Do you wanna wet it?
It's fresh for you
You know you can get it
Well you choose

I like the way I move around (me gusta)
When you're around, yeah
I like to taste in my mouth (me gusta)
All in my mouth

I be climbing up the naughty tree, naughty tree
When you're feeling for the monster me, monster me
I be climbing up the naughty tree, naughty tree
When you're feeling for the monster me

I like the way you're making my bittersweet, bittersweet
I like the taste, if you it makes me feel so weak, feel so weak
Girl

When you gone set it
Spread it all out on the table
Know that you can get it
Anything you want, you got it
You like melons, taste like heaven when I bite it
I'm no felon, but I can be bad for the good life

I like the way I move around (me gusta)
When you're around, yeah
I like to taste in my mouth (me gusta)
All in my mouth

I be climbing up the naughty tree, naughty tree
When you're feeling for the monster me, monster me
I be climbing up the naughty tree, naughty tree
When you're feeling for the monster me

I like the way you're making my bittersweet, bittersweet
I like the taste, if you it makes me feel so weak, feel so weak
Girl

Listen so I can just let go and you can feel that flow (ohh)
Listen so I can just let go and you can feel that flow
No, no, no

I like the way you're making my bittersweet, bittersweet
I like the taste, if you it makes me feel so weak, feel so weak
Oh nah, nah, nah
