Shawty bend ur hair can you hear me
Have u ever known fear come near to me
Can u follow follow come follow follow
Am running running cos am on the side of Brazilian things
You ever look so deep You forget you could fly
You forget you could fly,you should know how to fly
HOOK
Do You Remember when
Do You Remember when
Oh oh oh oh
Do You Remember when
Do You Remember when
Oh oh oh oh
VERSE 1
Always knew i could fly without to contact high
Way back when before the block got hot
Way back when before my friends got shot
Way back when when i was crushing a lot
Now i pull up on this bridges and i circle a block
Leave it to this news men they taught me a lot
Taught me not trust so i learn on my own
Street taught me how to hustle so i can't go wrong
No eating up my plate i bury a bone
No food in my crib i can't go home
You don't know how i live u can't condone
A lot of you stunting just wanna be hugged
A lot of you fronting just wanna be thugs
This world so cold men i wanna be drugged
You post online den you wanna be judged
Am cool with the hate i don't wanna be loved
HOOK
Do You Remember when
Do You Remember when
Oh oh oh oh
Do You Remember when
Do You Remember when
Oh oh oh oh
VERSE
Being so far they can't stop my growth
Being so alive like i died before
Living for my homies dat can't go free
Living for my homies dats R.I.P
Bury my heart but my soul gonna be
Before i swallow my pride i will swallow my teeth
Before i reach my men you can't eat
Before i reach my goals men i can't sleep
Told dem i was famous and they laughed at me
I could wreck a show like a crash would be
100 miles running and am 1 OD
Till the track bags go and i fly ooh we
Sound sucidal cos am dying to win
Sound so vital cos am at it again
Minding my religion need a blessing again
Swear i can't hear who is talking again
