Undo me baby

Undo that roof, undo that dress
Undo that coupe, I do the rest
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby

Got her off the moon and now she take control
Says she wanna party like we in the hills
Baby, I want you to fuck me like you never did
And licking the glass for me, licking the glass for me, woah
Jump in the coupe, jump with the bands like bop
You say we doin' no talking, got enough bands to pay off the cops
I wanna give it to you, I wanna tickle that box
I'm on the PCH, switchin' lanes, get top with no top

Undo that roof, undo that dress
Undo that coupe, I do the rest
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby

Undo me baby

Undo me baby, undo me baby
Tonight, I don't want head, I don't usually baby
Come do me baby, it's too amazing
I'll keep it on the hush as long as you won't say shit
She wanna fuck, I might just lick it and tickle and touch it and treat it like she was the blunt
I get in back of that body like I was never tryna be in the front
I know that it's never enough
But I'm puttin' the weed in the blunt and the three in the cup, and I'm hoping you fuck
