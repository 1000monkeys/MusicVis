Hook:
Margiela my feet when I walk in
Big bro just brought the wock in
I just did coke on a comet
She drops hearts in my comments
She got the hearts on her garments
I paint her face like a artist
Barely just started I'm still a rookie but I'm in the field like a sergeant
Brand new rifle straight off the web
He wanted that smoke gave my chop ah new friend
Don't hit my phone if it ain't bout that bread
Diss on lil deadboy you on CBS
Only like pretty hoes, money ah miracle
My piece gon dance just like Selena
Jitter its cold, I'm so charming I'm told
Finna try it on my new bae Selina
Verse:
Hey, Woah
Finna try it on my bae Selena
Mixin' red with the blue like I'm Peter
Gotta bih from the Bay she a eater
Yellow bone from the block
She givin me top
When I hit from the back I found out she ah skeeter
Niggas be opps and I can't be caught lackin
So niggas live life in the need of a heater
Niggas done glo'd up and I got my bread up
And no I didn't think I would fuck on my teacher
She had ah twin so i fucked on her sister
These niggas copy and paste I'm official
Bae gon' pull up on me and just like the old spice commercial her coochie gon' whistle
Bae so pretty I dropped these kids on her dimples
She couldn't catch a wave so she lost in the ripples
