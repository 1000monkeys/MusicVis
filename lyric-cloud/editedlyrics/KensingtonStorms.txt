I don't want to be alarmed
I don't want to know what's coming
I don't want to lie here
Waiting for my end
If I knew how to fight it
I would never go, never go dark

I will never be a storm again
But if it's easier now then I'll pretend
I'll never be a storm again
But if it's easier now then I'll pretend

Don't want to be alone
But genuine lives won't appear
On the horizon
Oh what a long wait
If there's no way to find it
Will I ever calm, ever calm down?

I will never be a storm again
But if it's easier now then I'll pretend
I'll never be a storm again
But if it's easier now then I'll pretend

To leave it all
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?
Am I pretending?

Don't want to be alarmed
Don't want to know what's coming
