Ripping my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word, and it's over
Ripping through like a missile, ripping through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
And it's over
Raise your weapon
You won't feel a thing (You won't feel a thing)
For your war

Dropping your bombs now, on all we built
How does it feel now, to watch it burn, burn, burn
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
Raise your weapon
Raise your --pon
You won't feel a thing (You won't feel a thing)
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
