When we're talking and nobody's there
We're safely in the dark alone
A conversation that nobody hears
Is transferring from home to home
By the time we figure it out
It's already set in stone
And if everything I feel down inside my chest
Completely fills me up like a real, real, real

Connection
It's not that typical
We're connecting
But it's all in digital

I'll share a story I want you to know
It's better than the real thing
I took my time retouching myself
To enhance my personality
There's no need to dig any further
I've laid it all out, it's clear
And everything you feel down inside your chest
Completely fills you up like a real, real, real

Connection
It's not that typical
We're connecting
But it's all in digital

I just need this so much
I thought I was enough
For you, for me
I thought this was my destiny
And then the trail went cold
I looked everywhere
But were you ever really there
I thought we had a real, real, real

Connection
It's not that typical
We're connecting
But it's all in digital
