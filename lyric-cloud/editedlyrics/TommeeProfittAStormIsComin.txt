Something waits within the shadows
Like an army in the night
Lock the doors and board the windows
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh

A storm is comin', that you can't escape
Tears are fallin', like blood and rain
Thunder's shaking, and it's gonna break
A storm is comin', that you can't escape

Tears are falling' from the darkness
Feel them crash upon your skin
Look for shelter, you won't find it
No-o, no-o

A storm is comin', that you can't escape
Tears are fallin', like blood and rain
Thunder's shaking, and it's gonna break
A storm is comin', that you can't escape, no

Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, a storm is comin'
