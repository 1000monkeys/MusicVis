He he x 6
Come on
He he
Give it up (wahoo)
It's friday night and I'm alone
The stars are out and I'm at home
Feel like I’m coming out alive
See the knuckles turning white (wahoo)
It’s Friday night and no one’s home, home
I'm in the city all alone, lone
Feel like a carnival tonight
Strap me up and take a ride, ride
An' round and round she goes
And where she stops, no one knows
An' round and round she goes
And where she stops, no one knows, knows
Feel it coming on now x 10
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it...
I got your money (woohoo)
I got your money (woohoo)
I'll treat you honey (woohoo)
I'll keep you up for days (uh, uh)
I got your sugar (uh, uh)
I’ll be your hooker (uh, uh)
I'll keep you up for days
Saturday night I'm fucking stoned, stoned
While all the suckers got the jones, jones
I'm on the freeway, gonna blow, blow
The red lights saying go, go
Saturday night I'm fucking gone, gone
And all my friends are saying don't, don't
The world is flashing like a strobe, strobe
Push the pedal sayin' woah, woah, woah... (shit...)
(I'm hot)
I got your money (go, go)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I treat you honey
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I got your money (go, go)
Hold on, hold on
Come on (woohoo)
I got your money (woohoo)
I'll treat you honey (woohoo)
I'll keep you up for days (uh, uh)
I got your sugar (uh, uh)
I’ll be your hooker (uh, uh)
I'll keep you up for days (woohoo)
I got your money
I'll treat you honey
I'll keep you up for day...
I'll keep you up for days (come on)
(I'm in the runnin' now)
Hold on
Hold on (you wanna rock now?)
Hold on
Coming down now...
(Wahoo)
It’s Sunday morning, I'm with you
How did I end up in this room?
I’m in a bed that isn’t mine
The walls are closin' in tight, tight
It’s Sunday morning, I'm with you, you
Your voice is like a sonic boom, boom
And round and round she goes, goes
And where she stops no one knows, knows
And round and round she goes
And where she stops no one knows
And round and round she goes
And where she stops no one knows, knows
