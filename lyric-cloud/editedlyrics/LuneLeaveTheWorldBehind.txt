People, can you hear me?
Here's the message 
that
 I'm sending out
I've got the answers, to all your problems
And tonight I'll be singing it loud
Just surrender yourself to the rythm
With your hands up in the sky
Feel the energy deep inside your system
And leave this world behind
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
And leave this world behind
Leave the world behind you
(Please leave the world behind)
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
You got to leave this world behind
People, can you hear me?
Here's a message that I'm sending now
Just surrender yourself to the rhythm
With your hands up in the sky
Feel the energy deep inside your system
And leave this world behind
Leave this world behind
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
And leave this world behind
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
And leave this world behind
