It started when you was a kid
Your parents were open minded
Fascinated by the shine of coins
You have to be thrifty and you´ll get it
Don ´t worry about the money
I got my piggy bank
Don ´t worry about the money
Save up in my piggy bank
Nice feature has been changed
You preffer drink, but don´t like to pay
Earning money like no-one else
Still whimpering for a cigarettes
Don ´t worry about the money
I got my piggy bank
Don ´t worry about the money
Close up in my piggy bank
The story is still open
But your friends are also more open minded
They call you nigga, but you don´t care
You want still more but you´ll get it - alone
