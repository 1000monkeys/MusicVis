(Hey!, come on up)

Another manic Monday, praying for the week to go by
While 
Jimmy
's at the golf course, smoking on a Cuban Delight

Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But right now, I could use a vacation

I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday

Another torture Tuesday; I cannot seem to open my eyes
While Suzie's at the dayspa getting ready for Jimmy tonight

Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But right now, I just need a vacation

I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday

(Ooooh, Ooooh, Ooooh)
We don't wanna work no more
(Ooooh, Ooooh, Ooooh)
Life is just too short

Now money, money, we all got to make it, yeah
But everyday  should be a vacation

I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
I wish it was Sunday, Sunday funday
A Monday-to-Monday Sunday funday
Sunday funday
(Ooooh, Ooooh, Ooooh, sunday funday, ah yeah)

We don't wanna work no more (sunday funday)
Life is just too short (sunday funday)
