There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All that I had was all I'm gonn' get
Mm

There's a possibility
There's a possibility
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare

So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one who knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know
Mm
Mm

Know that when you leave
Know that when you leave
By blood and by me, you walk like a thief
By blood and by me, I fall when you leave

So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one who knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know
So tell me when my sorrow's over
You're the reason why I'm closed
Tell me when you hear me falling
There's a possibility it wouldn't show
Mm
Mm

By blood and by me, I'll fall when you leave
By blood and by me, I'll follow your lead

Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm
