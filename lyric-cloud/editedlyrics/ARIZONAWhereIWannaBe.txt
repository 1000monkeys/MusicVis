I build my love like a castle in the sand
And when it comes down
It comes tumbling to the ground
And when she speaks
It's a dangerous fantasy
That sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
And her hair blows like a lighter in the wind
And I lose my senses baby
It gets under my skin
And when she speaks, she's all I'll ever need
She sets me free
To where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
I build my love like a castle in the sand
And when it comes down
It comes tumbling to the ground
And when she speaks
It's a dangerous fantasy
Sets me free
To where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
She sets me free to where I wanna be
