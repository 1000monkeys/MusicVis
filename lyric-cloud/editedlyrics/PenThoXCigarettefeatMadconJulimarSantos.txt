I don't get up on a Sunday
I rather just waste my days alone
I used to be summer
But now i’m cold
It's hard when love
Only goes one way
It feels like i'm falling over board
But I will survive
Least that what I’m told
Empty battle whiskey didn't help
To drawn the pain
While they tell me don't be silly
Cause you will find love again
But it's nothing I wanna look for
It all feels like a threat
Oh no, cause it burns
It burns
It burns like a cigarette
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
It burns like a cigarette
The way you broke my heart
There's no more space in the ashtray
I haven't been touch
But broke my bones
Can someone explain to me
Why I'm low?
Cause you took my pride
And left me with shame
I guess I got only myself to blame
If i can get up
Only lord knows
Empty battle whiskey didn't help
To drawn the pain
While they tell me don’t be silly
Cause you will find love again
But it’s nothing I wanna look for
It all feels like a threat
Oh no, cause it burns
It burns
It burns like a cigarette
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
It burns like a cigarette
The way you broke my heart
We let it go, way out a hand
I hate but she hating me back
This bitch is breaking me bad
I was never one for the petty shit
More the type to find my way out the bullshit
I was drowning
And you, didn't do shit
I just laugh deez days I’m through witcha
It's like my nerves are numb
But I can still feel the pain
I how you burned me sum
All my friends telling me to turn around
And get some new fish going
Trying to serve me some
But uh, it feels like I can't move a muscle
I'm flippin’em channels but ain't watching shit
Except for my heart on a tray chopped in bits
And it's all because of the way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
The way you broke my heart
Heart... Heart... Heart...
The way you broke my heart
