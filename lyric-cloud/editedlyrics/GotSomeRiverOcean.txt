Eisha, bitch fuck you
Messy ass hoe

I came up writing for bitches
I had to lie for some bitches
Just cause you don't like a bitch, I can't be poppin these bitches
If it's the other way around you wouldn't step for yo bitches
These hoes lame, don't forget that I been blessing you bitches
All that 
Eisha No!
 shit, it was a cute ass bop
Best believe if I didn't write it it'll be a fuck ass flop
I don't gotta throw shade cause I'm a real bitch (Real bitch shit)
I send out my little shooters, on mama they screaming slatt
But you be hanging out with bitches you don't even like forreal
Ew
Weird hoes be screaming its on sight forreal, weird
But one thing we know, yo nigga Uno is a hoe
Plus he done fucked with every bitch that done walked through yo door
Ms. Ocean, river lake don't want yo man, hoe
Like Jhacari, bitch we flying to Japan hoe
We bout a bag, we ain't worried bout no broke hoe
Bitch pick up a pen, write a verse
You don't want smoke
Wait, how you mad at me because I write my own shit?
You know my flow is brazy crazy, yes I'm really with the shit
But since you since you need a writing coach I'mma help you push your pen, bitch
I'mma Shether you
That's how I do a bitch that ain't my friend
Push your own pen and watch your mouth before you come for me
Listen to your mama, I can make you pick up all your teeth
Trying hood bitches, that's gon get yo ass knocked out
You put my business out there, now your little clout got knocked out
Little bitch
Eisha bitch shut up (Che noooo)

Now, fuck having some manners
I'm not here for no drama, I am just here from some answers
Swear she run Atlanta but she from Louisiana
And she not too hard to handle, I'll eat every damn dancer
You live for the drama, you a woahing ass ratchet
Write your own music, but you couldn't make it happen
If dancing don't work out, start selling lashes
You know you only famous for doing them Dubsmashes
I'm all in ya city and I'm dancing like I'm Diddy
Heard ya nigga kinda iffy, do he really want the kitty?
Them folks you hang with do clout chasing lame shit
All of em nameless, thirsty to be famous
Trade the bullets for bars
Trade the pistols for pens
If we fighting with talent, then the girl cannot win
I seen you in that red wig, fix that shit
I am never too busy to come and humble a bitch
Now p--

First off, suck my dick
Y'all ain't fucking with me
Broke bummy ass bitches ain't comparing to me
Pretty face, nice smile, bitch I'm PYT
Got ya nigga in my phone tryna link up with me
I got your nigga!
I just make him eat the cat, ain't no laying with me
Swipe the Visa, get the cash, you a sponsor to me
I been up and down the coast, bitch I step in these streets
You bitches hard up on the net (Kill that chatting, let's meet)
I got some niggas that be sliding, yeah they step bout a bitch
Hop out the sprinter there they go
We tryna step on a bitch
Fuck a mask, they walking down
Yeah they slide on that shit
And if it's beef then it's beef, we ain't squashing shit bitch
I'm a hot bitch
I'm Bobby Shmurda on the block with my Glock, bitch
White toes throwing bows on a opp bitch
I got your nigga and his money, hahaha bitch
Say you wanna beef with me but you ain't bout shit
I been that bitch before the gram, fuck that hype shit
Up the score, don't play the gram, I really slide shit
And if it's up then it's stuck
Ain't no hiding, bitch
Was talking left but it's okay, you got the right bitch
Eisha, bitch fuck you
Scary ass hoe
