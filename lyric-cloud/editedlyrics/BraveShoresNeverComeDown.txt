So sorry, as I've missed you
Hair, I was whipping round
So high up, got my chin up
I don't care if I never come down
I don't care if I never come down

So sorry, as I've missed you
Running with the crazy crowd
I'm climbing, going higher
I don't care if I never come down
I don't care if I never come down
I don't care if I never come down

So sorry, as I've missed you
Hair, I was whipping round
So high up, got my chin up
I don't care if I never come down
I don't care if I never come down
