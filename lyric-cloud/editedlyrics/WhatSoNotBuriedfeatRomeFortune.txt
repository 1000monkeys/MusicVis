High off the lifestyle, off the lifestyle

Girl, I heard, you buried her
Somewhere out of reach
Girl, I heard, you buried her
Somewhere, no one can see:

Look, eh, I said:
How the hell did it happen?
I'm serious, I ain't laughin'
You might overdose on this lifestyle
I'm scared for you, I ain't rappin'
How the hell did it happen?
I'm serious, I ain't laughin'
You might overdose on this lifestyle
I'm scared for you, I ain't rappin'
Shit, eh, this is the time to get it
This is the time to get it
You need to snap out of it nigga
I'm getting specific
Uh, this ain't about your rovers
This ain't about your bitches
This is about your soul, your morals
They got to be decent
Eh, and I'm just seeing for a difference
Eh, I think your goals is something different
Shit, open up your eyes bro!
You high off that life, you know!

Girl, I heard, you buried her
Somewhere out of reach
Girl, I heard, you buried her
Somewhere, no one can see:
