So follow me
Baby believe
'Cause every step that we take
Keeps us from falling down
So come with me
Maybe you'll see
That every move that we make
Keeps us from going down
So close, so close
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
We're almost home
We're so close, so close
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
We're almost home
We're almost home
We're almost home
So close, so close
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
We're almost home
We're so close, so close
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
We're almost home
We're almost home
We're almost home
We're almost home
We're almost home
We're almost home
