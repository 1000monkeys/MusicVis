I had to look up when I saw you
And almost being struck by lightning
Staring at the light of the stars
It's like looking in the mirror
Just before the dawn, it's the darkest
So if this what you are then you're honest
Everything is in on the outside
Clap as the sun goes down
Clap as the sun goes down

When the world stops spinnin' around
And gravity brings you down, don't give in
When the weight's too much to bare
And nobody seems to care, don't give in
Throw your hands to heaven

Look at what we've started
Everything comes from something
Love from pain, hope from hate and life from the rain

I'm not waiting, I'm drowning
And the elements won't give in, don't give in
Throw your hands to heaven
Heaven
