It's a funny feeling when you're living your life facing the door
I can't even describe myself, I wish I knew how to obey the rules

To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh

I've been trying to sell the old
Always wanting back want its soul
There's a hole where you used to live
Still I can't let myself get in

To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh, To you oeh

So how come in the morning 
Find a way to find your love
I lay awake, might be a mistake
Could I be the only one you callin' in the morning
So how come in the morning 
Find a way to find your love
I lay awake, might be a mistake
Could I be the only one you callin' in the morning

Please don't say you need me
Please don't say you need me


So how come in the morning 
Find a way to find your love
I lay awake, might be a mistake
Could I be the only one you callin' in the morning
So how come in the morning 
Find a way to find your love
I lay awake, might be a mistake
Could I be the only one you callin' in the morning
So how come in the morning 
Find a way to find your love
I lay awake, might be a mistake
Could I be the only one you callin' in the morning
So how come in the morning 
Find a way to find your love
I lay awake, might be a mistake
Could I be the only one you callin' in the morning
