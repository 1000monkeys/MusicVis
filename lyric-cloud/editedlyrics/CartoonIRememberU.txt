When I close my eyes, I can almost see it
When I take a breath, you fill up my lungs
And if my mind worked backwards just for a minute
I'd hold onto you
Before the memory is gone

I remember you
You lift my spirit
With you high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive
I remember you
You make me stronger
Can't go without end much longer
Remember, remember

I remember you
You lift my spirit
With you high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive
I remember you
You make me stronger
Can't go without end much longer
Remember, remember

When I close my eyes, I can almost see it
Hmmm
When I take a breath, you fill up my lungs
And if my mind worked backwards just for a minute
I'd hold onto you, before the memory is gone

I remember you
You lift my spirit
With you high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive
I remember you
You make me stronger
Can't go without end much longer
Remember, remember

I remember you
You lift my spirit
With you high is all I'm feeling
Remember how we felt alive
I remember you
You make me stronger
Can't go without end much longer
Remember, remember
I remember you
