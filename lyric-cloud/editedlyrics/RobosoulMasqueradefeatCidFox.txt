(1st Verse)
Hiding behind a disguise
Can you feel me watching you?
It's magic then I'm lost in your spell
But you don't even have a clue
(Chorus)
That I 'am hypnotized yeah
I'm drawn to your eyes
I just wanna see your face
Welcome to my Masquerade
Masquerade
(2nd Verse)
Who are you?
What is your name?
Is this a two-faced game?
It's tragic 'cuz after tonight
My heart will never be the same
(Chorus)
And I 'am hypnotized yeah
I'm drawn to your eyes
I just wanna see your face
Welcome to my Masquerade
Masquerade(x2)
I just wanna see your face
Masquerade(X2) (X2)
