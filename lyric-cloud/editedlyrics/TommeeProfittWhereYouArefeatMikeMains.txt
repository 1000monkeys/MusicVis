I know you're bruised by the world
Trying to clean your wounds
Wearing a mask with a smile
I see you

If you want you can go through this life alone
Let me know how it goes without a hand to hold

All the while, heart is torn
I just wanna be where you are
Through the fire, through the storm
I just wanna be where you are

Until the life leaves my body
I'll help you stand your ground
No looking back on our mistakes
They can't touch us now

If you want you can go through this life alone
Let me know how it goes without a hand to hold

All the while, heart is torn
I just wanna be where you are
Through the fire, through the storm
I just wanna be where you are

We'll both keep walking
Through hell or heaven
Through unsurvivable odds
Through pain and sorrow
We'll build our tomorrow
'Cause in the end it's worth the cost

All the while, heart is torn
I just wanna be where you are
Through the fire, through the storm
I just wanna be where you are
All the while, heart is torn
I just wanna be where
I wanna be, I wanna be
Through the fire, through the storm
Where you are (I just wanna be where you are) You are
All the while, heart is torn
I just wanna be where you are
(Where you are, where you are, I wanna be where you are)
Through the fire, through the storm (I wanna be where you are)
I just wanna be where you are (Where you are)
