She's tripping on her heels and dancing to the Beatles
And I told her last night
She was down at the Echo, but she can't just let go
And everybody feel alright

You dance so rock and roll, sunglasses and alcohol
Silk stockings and a day old dress
You gotta whip it when you came out west

Following after
Following after you
Following after
Following after you
Following after
Following after you

Life is so funny when you got no money
You still can go out at night
You can dance to the music and you can't refuse it
That everything will be alright

You dance so rock and roll, sunglasses and alcohol
Silk stockings and rock and roll
You really move in those brand new soles
Do you wanna be my girl?
