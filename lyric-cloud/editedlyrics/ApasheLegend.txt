(Yeah, yeah)
Tiptoe on the ledge (Yeah)
Live life on the edge (Yeah)
Pistol to the head (Yeah)
I'ma die a legend (Legend, huh?)
I'ma die a legend (Yeah, yeah)
I'ma die (ey) (Ooh)

Legendary (Yeah)
I'll be legendary (Uh, yeah)
Necessary (Yeah)
Saw my death, it's scary
Ancestors dead already
Death hereditary
Won't stop unless I'm buried (Yeah)
And I ain't ever ready (Yeah)

They say life's a bitch, well I say fuck it, I'll seduce her (ey)
Rock Versace shades in case I run into Medusa (ey)
Face to face with death but she was blinded by my jeweler
They say God don't like no ugly, well I'm lucky 'cause I'm cuter (ey) (ey)
I wear all black just in case now
Yeah fuck the world, I'll be face down
They kissing asses at funerals
I keep 'em pissed like a urinal
Death 'round the corner, don't trust him
Don't even fuck with his cousin
I stay awake 'cause I'm wondering
When will it all fade to nothing?
Nah, fuck that
Tell the reaper I ain't ready
I'ma fight him, he ain't scary
I'm a beast and in the Belly
All eyes on me, shut them rarely
I got 2 packs, come and get me
'Gainst the world and if the dead me
I'll be back like Macaveli

I can see my death from here
The more I look the less is clear
The end is near, offend your fears
And fuck the tears, this is a legend year
I can see my death from here
The more I look the less is clear
The end is near, offend your fears
And fuck the tears, this is a legend year
