If you really wanna kill me
You need to think bigger
If you really wanna take me down
You need to try harder
'Cuz I pray to the dark of the moon
It's makin' me shiver
If you really wanna take me down
You need to think bigger

It's a dead moon, I'm the grim reaper
Can you feel me? I can feel your fever
Staring at the moon, staring at the moon, both stop
Staring at the moon
I'm a dead one, you're a true believer
Can you hear me? I can feel your fever
Staring at the moon, staring at the moon, both stop
Staring at the moon

Death is my friend, and life is my window
Never lookin' out cuz I don't wanna face it
Should I pretend that it's not the end?
I'm never lookin' up cuz I don't wanna face it
The roof caved in and the drugs wore out
And then God came down and he kissed my mouth
He said "it's all my fault," and he began to shout
Save me, save me, save me, oh

It's a dead moon, I'm the grim reaper
Can you feel me? I can feel your fever
Staring at the moon, staring at the moon, both stop
Staring at the moon
I'm a dead one, you're a true believer
Can you hear me? I can feel your fever
Staring at the moon, staring at the moon, both stop
Staring at the moon

If you really wanna take me down
Pray to the dark of the moon
It's makin me shiver (shiver shiver shiver shiver)
If you really wanna take me down
You need to try harder
'Cuz I pray to the dark of the moon
The roof caved in and the drugs wore out
And then God came down and he kissed my mouth
He said "it's all my fault," and he began to shout
Save me, save me, save me

It's a dead moon, I'm the grim reaper
Can you feel me? I can feel your fever
Staring at the moon, staring at the moon, both stop
Staring at the moon (I can feel your fever)
I'm a dead one, you're a true believer
You a live one, I can feel your fever
Staring at the moon, staring at the moon, both stop
Staring at the moon
