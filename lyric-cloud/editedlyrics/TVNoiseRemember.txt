Take my heartache, bury it deep inside
Take my trouble, bury it deep inside
Where nobody can go

I don't wanna be another lonely soul, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be another lonely soul, oh

You left me standing there
You say you don't remember
What about all those years
You say you don't remember

Take my heartache, bury it deep inside
Take my trouble, bury it deep inside
Where nobody can go

I don't wanna be another lonely soul, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be another lonely soul, oh

You left me standing there
You say you don't remember
What about all those years
You say you don't remember, yeah

You say you don't remember
You say you don't remember

You left me standing there
You say you don't remember
What about all those years
You say you don't remember
