I saw what became of the future
We all watch as the faces start to pass
No turning back (No turning back)
Some fall under waves of confusion
Some crawl—some days just fade to black
Then itʼs in the past (Just like that)

And itʼs all been for what cause?
For what goddess or what god?
For whoʼs profit and whoʼs loss?
We fade to black
Cause we canʼt face the facts

Canʼt face the facts

So I call on the serfs in the center
Donʼt fall for the snares laid in your path
They want that (Yeah they want that)
I know that itʼs hard to remember
But you know they will shatter if you act
Just like that (Just like that)

And itʼs all been for what cause?
For what goddess or what god?
For whoʼs profit and whoʼs loss?
We fade to black
Cause we canʼt face the facts

Canʼt face the facts

45 homicides by the 9 on my mind
While a drive-by cuts another life line
Fortified by the lies on my timeline
Four or five guys buy up half the skyline
My my these are tryinʼ times
But weʼre titans when weʼre fighting in our right mind
Iʼd like to take it back
Itʼs high time we face the facts
