Ay, I got a bad girl, I got a brain-with-an-ass girl (Stay gold)
She got a mean bop, I got a lean to the way I walk
And they get it like gold
G-O-L-D,  G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D,  G-O-L-D, that's—
I got a good thing with a bad bitch, that's rare bitch
She don't even like you hoes, she'll walk in the room take out a bitch, gold
G-O-L-D,  G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D,  G-O-L-D, that's gold

(Boo) Golden girl like them old bitches
Gold Rolly got more riches (Yeah)
Gold teeth when I'm in them trenches
Got gold records, I've been did it
Got gold
All on my neck to my clit ring
Got gold
Flavor for Wayne, here say "Bling Bling"
Gold with the diamond cut VVS
Gold all on me, won't see me stress
Goals I concurred it like "What's next?"
Gold in my Jesus piece, I'm so blessed
Got gold
Yellow gold, white gold, and rose gold
Got gold
Fuck wit' me, I'm taking your gold (Huh)
Used to dream of this
Now I'm on tour and receiving chips
Partying with whores and receiving lips
Queen of my city and I mean that shit
Got Gold
So much you'd think that I sold pounds of
Gold
R. Kelly hoes gave him golden showers (Uh)
Rock gold wit' my Prauda swag
Got gold in my Gucci bag
Cop gold when I blow a bag
Old gold I forgot I had
Gold all between these big thick legs
Gold on my tongue ring like gold head

And they get it like gold
G-O-L-D,  G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D, G-O-L-D, that's...
I got a good thing with a bad bitch, that's rare bitch
She don't even like you hoes, she'll walk in the room take out a bitch, gold
G-O-L-D,  G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D, G-O-L-D, that's gold

Check it out, gold is shiny, gold is fun
Some like taking gold with guns
A heart ain't gold if it don't like us
But go for the gold dumb fuck, good luck
A golden boy man good as gold
Golden rule is, "Don't lose your soul."
Piss on power, golden shower
Golden rays of sun grow my dope
Look at my gold
Going for the gold 'fore a G get old and his heart grow cold
I go-go-go for every year my career was slow
And seemed that it wouldn't go
And you should know, we pitch these rhymes
Like Smoltz, like Glavine, like Maddux in ninety-five
And now we shine just like Eddie
Golden teeth from Greenbriar in ninety-nine
Can't be broke when you own gold rope
Pawn shops offering cash for those
Cash is fake though, gold accrues
I make my own gold, golden goose
Run down yellow brick roads toward riches
Just be sure to not trust no wizards
The golden age is now gone, admit it
All that's gold is not gold that glitters
Thirty-six inch Cuban as I'm movin' through Cuba
With a half a ki of gold on my neck (Shit)
Call me Gaddafi and pay me in gold
'Cause your money ain't really worth shit
Just a piece of paper to promote propaganda
To keep you in debt and know your dick
I see these dope boys had shit right all along
Puttin' gold all in them they bitch
