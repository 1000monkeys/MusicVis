When you are here
My heart is raised upon its self
When you are here
My heart is raised upon...

I feel it all, I feel it all, again
To feel it all, to feel it all, again
I feel it all, I feel it all, again
To feel it all, to feel it all, again

When you are here
My heart is raised upon...
When you are here
My heart is raised upon...

When you are here...
When you are here...
