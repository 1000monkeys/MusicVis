All your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue

Soaking, got my hair around your fingertips
Feel the texture falling down my hip
We're diving, we're diving deeper
Sailing, on your lips and slowly on your skin
I just need to have a taste of it
We're diving, we're diving deeper

Deep into dark waters
Leaning on, you lover
Drowning in the voice of you

And all your different shades of blue
And all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue
And all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue

Dying, for how you lift me up against the wall
Then carry me away to second floor
We're shifting positions
Breathing, while inhaling every sip of you, love
I just need to have a taste of it
We're diving, we're diving deeper

Deep into dark waters
Leaning on you, lover
Drowning in the voice of you

And all your different shades of blue
And all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue
And all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue

All your different shades of blue
And all your, all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue

And all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue
And all your, all your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue
All your different shades of blue
