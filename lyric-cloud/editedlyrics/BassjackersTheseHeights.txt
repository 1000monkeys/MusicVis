Some kind of magic that lies underneath
Could have been tragic but we found the peace
Up to the mountains and under the sheets we go, we go
Work hard and sleep less and wait for the dream
No time to regret what we haven’t seen
Let downs and freak outs and storms clouds and us below
We made it out, made it out

Good life with a couple bad times
A million mistakes, but we made it out fine
This life, yeah, it always finds a way

To lead us to these heights
To lead us to these heights

No explanations for coming this far
The things turned around when I turned on my heart
I’ll thank the sun when he heals all my scars for good, for good
Thought it was impossible, but we always find a way
Of lookin' out, lookin' out
Over these heights that we never thought we’d say
We made it out, made it out

Good life with a couple bad times
A million mistakes, but we made it out fine
This life, yeah, it always finds a way

To lead us to these heights
To lead us to these heights

To lead us to these heights
Lead us to these heights
Lead us to these
Lead us to these
Lead us to these heights
Lead us to these heights
Lead us to these heights
Lead us to these
Lead us to these
Lead us to these heights
Lead us to these

Good life with a couple bad times
A million mistakes, but we made it out fine
This life yeah, it always finds a way
To lead us to these heights
To lead us to these heights
