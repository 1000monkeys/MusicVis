I spent my whole life chained to the wall
Hungry for more
Not afraid to fall
I had to cut a man down to get where I am
But someone had to tumble
And someone had to stand

Don't try to fight
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you
It's too late to try
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you

I'm looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood

Most of my life was heavy and hard
So many days, so many scars
But it was all of those years to make me who I am
I broke through and here I stand

Don't try to fight
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you
It's too late to try
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you

I'm looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood


I'm looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood
