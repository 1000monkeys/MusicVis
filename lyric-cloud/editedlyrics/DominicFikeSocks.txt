I can't keep track of all my socks
I'm irresponsible, not because I'm a rockstar
You can call me what you want
I think I'd like to hear you talk

If I set fire to these walls right now (Right now)
Would I set foot inside your mind? (Would I?)
And if you say yes, am I allowed back in?

I hate the way it falls down
But I like the way it all sounds
And since you came back, I've been on guard
Watchin' my walls
And when you moved in, I think I knew then
That everything was
And all I want is your time

If I set fire to these walls right now (Right now)
Would I set foot inside your mind? (Would I?)
And if you say yes, am I allowed back in?
