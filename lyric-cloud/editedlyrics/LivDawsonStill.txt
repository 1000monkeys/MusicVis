Candles burning the same scent
Lampshades still a little bent
The things we love about still simple
Reminding me of way back when
We belong to simpler days
Before we broke and parted ways

As I lie amongst your sheets
You curl up against my heat
Memories running through our heads
On the same side of the bed
It feels like simpler days
Before we broke and parted ways

You're right hand still fits my left
You're still the one that knows me best
You're right hand still fits my left
You're still the one that knows me

Now we've reached the final scene
The saddest movie that I've seen
The credits role I think about the start
Replaying over all my favourite parts
How I long for simpler days
Before we broke and parted ways

You're right hand still fits my left
You're still the one that knows me best
You're right hand still fits my left
You're still the one that knows me
You're right hand still fits my left
You're still the one that knows me best
You're right hand still fits my left
You're still the one that knows me
