Feeling the birth of a new day
Isn't the sunrise with our souls?
Yesterday promises I've been made
I feel the birth of a new day

I'm stepping out of life for the very first time
I'M A WILD CHILD!
I'm out of my mind, I'm one of a kind
I'M A WILD CHILD!
I'm out of my mind, I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind, I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind, I'm one of a kind
I'M A WILD CHILD!
I'm stepping out of life for the very first time
I'M A WILD CHILD!
I'm out of my mind, I'm one of a kind
I'M A WILD CHILD!

Yesterday promises I've been made
I feel the birth of a new day

I'm stepping out of life for the very first time
I'M A WILD CHILD!
I'm out of my mind, I'm one of the kind
I'M A WILD CHILD!
