You take me higher than love
You're making me feel some kind of way
I know we see
You take me higher than love
You're making me feel some kind of way
You take me there

And this is how it goes
And this is how it goes

You take me higher than love
You're making me feel some kind of way
I know we see
You take me higher than love
You're making me feel some kind of way
You take me there
You take me there
You take me there

And this is how it goes
And this is how it goes
