I can see
Baby, you're just like me
Keep falling free
Running round, chasing dreams

Stuck on the ground
Lost, never found
Gotta get out this place
Babe, if you dare
Come up for air
We could just fly away

We can get high, we can get high, touchin' the sky
Never gonna come back down
We can run wild, shootin' stars now, faster than sound
Build a kingdom in the clouds
We can get high, high, high, high, high, high
Can get high, high, high, high, high
We can get high, high, high, high, high, high
Can get high, high, high, high, high
We can get— (Woo)
We can get— (Hey)

Wake me when
It's time for us to fly again
We've just begun
Reaching out to touch the sun

Stuck on the ground
Lost, never found
Gotta get out this place
Babe, if you dare
Come up for air
We could just fly away

We can get high, we can get high, touchin' the sky
Never gonna come back down
We can run wild, shootin' stars now, faster than sound
Build a kingdom in the clouds
We can get high, high, high, high, high, high
Can get high, high, high, high, high
We can get high, high, high, high, high, high
Can get high, high, high, high, high
We can get– (Woo)
We can get– (Ah, woo)
We can get– (Hey)
