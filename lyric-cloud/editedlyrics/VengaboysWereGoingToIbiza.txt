Hello, party people!
This is Captain Kim speaking
Welcome aboard Venga Airways
After take-off we'll pump up the sound system
'Cause we're going to Ibiza!

I don't wanna be a bus driverâ€‹
All my life
I'm gonna pack my bags and leave this town
Grab a flight
Fly away on Venga Airways
Flyin' high, Ibiza sky

I look up at the sky
And I see the clouds
I look down at the ground
And I see the rain go down the drain
Fly away on Venga Airways
Flyin' high, Ibiza sky

Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea

Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh

Far away from this big town
And the rain
It's really very nice to be
Home again
Fly away on Venga Airways
Flyin' high, Ibiza sky

Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea

Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh
Ioh ioh, oh we oh, oh we oh

Thank you for flying Venga Airways
We are now approaching Ibiza airport
As you can see, the sky is blue
And the beach is waiting for you

Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea
Whoa! We're going to Ibiza
Whoa! Back to the island
Whoa! We're gonna have a party
Whoa! In the Mediterranean Sea

Whoa! We're going to Ibiza!
