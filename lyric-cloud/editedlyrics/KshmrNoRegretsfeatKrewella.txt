So I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets

Friend of mine
I get lost on the highway
The wind keeps taking me one way
They all say I won't be happy where I end up
Love of mine
I got good times in my blood
How many bottles are too much?
They all say I don't know where to stop

But I don't want to sacrifice the little things
That make life worth living, life worth living

So I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air (Hey)
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Everything I break (Hey)
And all of my mistakes
I can die with no regrets


I can die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets

Friend of mine
We've had heartaches that hurt bad
But no, I won't turn the clock back
'Cause one day we'll know it's a part of the plan, oh
Love of mine
One day the sun will not rise
We don't got time to waste time
So I'm gonna do it while I can

But I don't wanna sacrifice the little things
That make life worth living, life worth living

So I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air (Hey)
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Everything I break (Hey)
And all of my mistakes
I can die with no regrets


I can die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Everything I break
And all of my mistakes
I can die with no regrets

(I roll)
(I roll)
(I roll)
(I can die with no regrets)
