What's wrong with me
I'm drifting like a ghost on the sidewalk
I follow you my love
Hiding in a blur of emotions

I can't say no
Though you there when I'm high
You're gone when I'm low
I'm lost in your world
Tell me, who have I become
When I can't say no

To you, to you oh, to you
When I can't say no
to you, to you oh, to you
When I can't say no

When I can't say no

I've clipped my wings and waited
For a cloud with saddle and reins
I'm glue-tied to your fingers
And now I can't walk away

What's wrong with me
I'm drifting like a ghost on the sidewalk
I follow you my love
Hiding in a blur of emotions
I can't say no!
Though you there when I'm high
You're gone when I'm low
I'm lost in your world
Tell me, who have I become
When I can't say no
When I can't say no

To you, to you oh, to you
to you, to you oh, to you
When I can't say no
To you, to you oh, to you
When I can't say no
To you, to you oh, to you
When I can't say no

To you, to you oh, to you
When I can't say no
To you, to you oh, to you
