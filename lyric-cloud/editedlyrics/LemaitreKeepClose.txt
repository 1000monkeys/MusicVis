I live a few blocks below, a neighbourhood I left for good
These pumps are full, because I'm roped to my end
And it feels so close, and it feels so close
Let s go see what s in store for sale please come with me
Gotta find some way to be, far away with company
Let s go see what s in store for sale please come with me
Gotta find some way to be, far away
Light peeps of nothing new
Lots of nights it scares a few
I said I'm right running round' this room
I probably spoke too soon
Let s go see what s in store for sale please come with me
Gotta find some way to be, far away with company
Let s go see what s in store for sale please come with me
Gotta find some way to be, far away
...Took me, far away
