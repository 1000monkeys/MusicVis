Rise up
Rise up

You gotta rise up, you got a second chance to dance
You gotta rise up, oh, revenge is sweet, it is in your feet
You gotta rise up, show 'em how we roll, on the dance floor
You gotta rise up, like a phoenix through the flames

You gotta rise up
You gotta rise up
You gotta rise up
You gotta rise up, that's how you get on top, that's how you stay on top
You gotta rise up, when they eliminate, you gotta levitate
You gotta rise up, when they give you pain, you gotta up the gain
You gotta rise up, like phoenix through the mother fucking flames

Rise up
Rise up
