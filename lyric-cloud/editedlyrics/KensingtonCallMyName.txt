Lies give me lies
Run for the tides
All of my life
Holding on to save us
Holding on to break our downfall
Fire give me fire
Water to wine
All in your eyes
Holding on to save us
Roaming on the grey old grounds beneath
You relight us
You're not even trying
To relight us
You throw it in the fire
You will call my name
You will call my name
And we'll beat them all
When you call my name
When you call my name
I will be the one
You will call my name
You will call my name
And we'll beat them all
When you call my name
When you call my name
I will be there
Lies give me lies
Run with the blind
Crawl in the light
You throw it off the table
You throw it on the ground for all to see
You relight us
You're not even trying
To relight us
You throw it in the fire
You will call my name
You will call my name
And we'll beat them all
When you call my name
When you call my name
I will be the one
You will call my name
You will call my name
And we'll beat them all
When you call my name
When you call my name
I will be there
Breathe the night
Inside you eyelids
You're giving us hope
Not giving up hope on us
And I'll be focused
On what i know was
Giving us hope
Giving us hope
You're giving us hope
So we won't fall down
You're giving us hope
So we won't fall down
You're giving us hope
So we won't fall down
You're giving us hope
Not giving up hope on us
You're giving us hope
Not giving up hope on us
