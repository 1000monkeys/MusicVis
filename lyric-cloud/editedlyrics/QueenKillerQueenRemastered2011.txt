She keeps Moet et Chandon, in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (A killer, a killer)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime


Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try? (Wanna try?)
