Got a head full of spiders
And a heart that isn't here
In a room full of liars
All my demons reappear

Broken cigarettes and bullet holes
One more to the chest and I'm alone
Nothing gets me any higher
And nothing ever will

Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missing
'Til they pull me out The Mystic

I bet nobody can remember
What color eyes are on my face
I'm a freak, I'm a pretender
I never really had a place

Broken cigarettes and bullet holes
One more to the chest 'til I'm alone
Nothing gets me any higher
And nothing ever will

Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missing
'Til they pull me out The Mystic

Tell the preacher not to pray
There's no angels where I go
Only pieces that I broke and
Scattered dreams across the globe
I'm home

Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missing
'Til they pull me out The Mystic
