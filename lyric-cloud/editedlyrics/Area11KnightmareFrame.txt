What is life but a burden for me
It comes alive as I try to sleep
All this anger burning inside, but buried deep
私と一緒に来てください！
一番、ゼロ
One step forward and two to the side
Every single time, whoa

I fall asleep and I feel I'm falling
Nightmare comes without warning (Patricide)
I can't seem to sleep (The guilt inside)
I can't stay awake
In my dreams, I feel I'm running towards her shining light
Cocooned in steel as you fall away

She shines for me, she shines for me
Just like glass I saw right through
Something I couldn't see, something I couldn't see
Until I changed my point of view
Inside a machine, inside a machine
I cannot let you go inside of me, inside of me
The will to change the world

Can a mask be the face of reason?
Eye to eye with a loaded mind
You will answer to the pieces left behind
Well, I watched her die in your arms, Zero, Zero
So kill a king with a sleight of hand
Freed, but they'll never understand

Fall asleep and I feel I'm falling
Nightmare comes without warning (Patricide)
I can't seem to sleep (The guilt inside)
I can't stay awake
In my dreams, I feel I'm running towards her shining light
Cocooned in steel as you fall

As you fall asleep (as you fall asleep)
(As you fall asleep, as you fall asleep)
(I can't seem to sleep)
(As you fall asleep, as you fall asleep)
She shines for me, she shines for me
Just like glass, she's just like glass
She shines for me, she shines for me, me
Whoa, whoa
(As you fall asleep, as you fall asleep)
(As you falls asleep, as you fall asleep)

She shines for me, she shines for me
Just like glass I saw right through
Something I couldn't see, something I couldn't see
Until I changed my point of view
Inside a machine, inside a machine
I cannot let you go inside of me, inside of me
The will to change the world
