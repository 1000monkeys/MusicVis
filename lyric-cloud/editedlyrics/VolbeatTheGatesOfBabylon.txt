Awakening a goddess in the dark
On a stake she's been hanging like a doll
Tried to reach for the underworld
Had to pass through the seven gates of hell

Naked, lost, and deprived of all
All the power that she had lost

Dear ancient god, reveal your home
At the gates of Babylon
Dear ancient one, I see your home
At the gates of Babylon

Sent by Lord Enki to find, the goddess Ishtar
And bring her back to life
The tale of death and rebirth will become
The walls of kings and the goddess that she was

Naked, lost, and deprived of all
All the power that she had lost

Dear ancient god, reveal your home
At the gates of Babylon
Dear ancient one, I see your home
At the gates of Babylon

Dear sister what have I done to deserve thy anger?
I passed through the seven gates, now all I had is yours
The underworld that you rule, I became a victim of
The messenger from another time has brought me home

Dear ancient god, reveal your home
At the gates of Babylon
Dear ancient one, I see your home
At the gates of Babylon

Dear ancient God, release your soul
At the gates of Babylon
Dear ancient one, I see your home
At the gates of Babylon
