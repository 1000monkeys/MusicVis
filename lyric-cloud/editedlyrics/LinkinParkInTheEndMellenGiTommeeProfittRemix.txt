Why did you left ?
And left me alone
My love
It hurts me
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
I remember when you said
That you only have me
You have me
My love
And now everything is dashed
From me you left
Why did you left...and left me alone?
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
You didn't want to understand me
And was easier for you to leave me
Why did you left ? My love !
Everything is wilderness around me
And i see only your face
Why did you left ? My love !
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
Outside is cold
And all it´s over
Since you left me
