We can find our desires, woooh
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot, woooh
Whether we like or not
They say we can love who we trust, ooh
But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions, ooh
What are feelings without emotions?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh , I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

I hang my hopes out on the line, ooh
Well they'd be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long, ooh
They'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks, Woo-oo
My words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions? Woo-oo
Can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand


I'm going in
I'm doing it
I'm hoping you'll
Will Understand
I'm doing it
I'm hoping you'll
Will Understand
