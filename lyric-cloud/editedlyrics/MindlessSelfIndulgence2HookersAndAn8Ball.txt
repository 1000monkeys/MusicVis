2 hookers and an 8 ball
Can you believe that I write this shit?
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Stupid people thinkin' I am cool
I definitely give myself props
And that way I always get what I want
I always try to keep my edge
With 2 hookers and an
8-ball, niggas and all the dope dealers
As I rock them digits and get
Freaky deaky with a front row ticket
For all of my bitches
Cause my momma said to pick the very best one
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Can you believe that I write this shit?
2 hookers and an 8 ball
It ain't that fucking hard
I'm standing up to all my abuse
And experiences where I lose
I'm struggling to keep my edge
With 2 hookers and an
8 ball, babies for all the fine ladies
Rollin out in my Mercedes
And into the 80's
With a bad case of rabies
And a high-top fade
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Can you believe that I write this shit
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Stupid people thinking I am cool
Saturday
Saturday
Saturday
One day
I'm not that fucking wonderful
No, no, no
I thought I told ya to go
I'm not that fucking wonderful
No, no, no
I thought I told ya to go
I'm not that fucking wonderful
No, no, no
I thought I told ya to go
Well then go
Fuckin go
8 ball, niggas and all the dope dealers
As I rock them digits and get
Freaky deaky with a front row ticket
For all of my bitches
Cause my momma said to pick the very best one
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Can you believe that I write this shit?
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Stupid people thinking I am cool
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Can you believe that I write this shit
2 hookers and an 8 ball
Stupid people thinking I am cool
