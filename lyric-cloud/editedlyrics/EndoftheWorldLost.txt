I didn't call out, never said "SOS"
Don't even know who I was saving my flare for
Each lonely winter‚ turning the gas back up
To thaw my heart in the frost

Man on the moon to the day that the star man died
I would've phoned you if I'da known how
From Yokohama right back to Camden Lock
I never knew I was lost

There was a shadow of us‚ shadow of us
In everything I looked for‚ everything I touched
I heard an echo of you singing in every room
Fading, changing into something new

And I don't feel the hurtin', hurtin' no more
When I'm around you
I spent my life searchin'‚ searchin' over
Lost till I found you

You lift me up, up, up‚ up, up, up, up in the clouds, ooh
Yeah, I was lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost till I found you

Nobody lied to you, not in the fairytales
Or in the books that you read in your bedroom
Beach and adrenaline, washing your fears away
You never knew you were lost

There was a shadow of us, shadow of us
In everything I looked for, everything I touched
I heard an echo of you singing in every room
Fading, changing into something new

And I don't feel the hurtin', hurtin' no more
When I'm around you
I spent my life searchin', searchin' over
Lost till I found you

You lift me up, up, up, up, up, up, up in the clouds, ooh
Yeah, I was lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost till I found you

I didn't call out, never said "SOS"
I would've phoned you if I'da known how
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up in the clouds, ooh
Yeah, I was lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost till I found you

And I don't feel the hurtin', hurtin' no more
When I'm around you
I spent my life searchin', searchin' over
Lost till I found you

You lift me up, up, up, up
(Up, up, up)
Yeah I was lost
(Up, up, up, up, up, up, up)
You lift me up
(Up, up, up, up, up, up)
Yeah I was lost
(Up, up, up, up, up, up, up)
