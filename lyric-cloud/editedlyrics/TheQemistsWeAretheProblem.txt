Yeah!
Ah!

You feel so close but you're so far away from me
I lose no hope so I still want to set you free
Climb so high, now you can finally see
What we have now is torn apart at the seams
I meant no joke when I wrote what I spoke last
You'll see me shutting the door on my dark past
You've come so far, now you can finally see
What we have now is torn apart at the seams

And if you haven't got there yet
Just read between the lines
The truth ain't hard to find
Inside your mind

If we are the problem and we all oppose
It's like a prison, you are not alone
If we are the problem and we all oppose
It's like a prison but we know this as home

It feels so far but it's ever so close to me
With just one word you could shape my reality
Where we are now's where we need to be
What we have now's torn apart at the seams
I meant no joke when I spoke what I wrote last
I'll always say what I shouldn't when I speak fast
You tell me how it's supposed to be
What we have now's torn apart at the seams

And if you haven't got there yet
Just read between the lines
The truth ain't hard to find
Inside your mind

If we are the problem and we all oppose
It's like a prison but you are not alone
If we are the problem and we all oppose
It's like a prison, we know this as home

You feel so close but you're so far away from me
I lose no hope so I still wanna set you free
Climb so high, now you can finally see
What we have now's torn apart at the seams

Torn apart at the seams
Torn apart at the seams
Torn apart at the seams
Torn apart at the seams

And if you haven't got there yet
Just read between the lines
The truth ain't hard to find
Inside your mind

If we are the problem and we all oppose
It's like a prison but you are not alone
If we are the problem and we all oppose
It's like a prison but we know this as home

But we know this as home
But we know this as home
But we know this as home
But we know this as home
