Will you lie with me, 'cause I've been feeling weak
Will you sing to me, so I can get some sleep
Can you be the touch that I need
'Cause I'm hoping to feel you next to me
There was a love that we used to know 
But we let it go
Let it go 
Remember how you cradled me to keep me strong
How I would sing to you, the whole night long
But I couldn't be all that you would need
Now I lie without you next to me
There was a love that we used to know 
But we let it go
Let it go 
Oo-ooh 
Oo-ooh (away-yeah-yeah) 
There was a love that we used to know 
But we let it go
Let it go 
There was a love that we used to know 
But we let it go
Let it go
