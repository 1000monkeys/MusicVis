Feel it coming
Streets are burnin'
Fallen empires
Blood and crossfire
The tides are turning
Fear the darkness
Hearts are trembling
From the shadows
Gaves and gallows
The world is ending

We’re ready for war
We’re ready for war
No stopping us now
No taking us down
We’ll get what we came here for
We’re ready for war

Hear the silence
Troubled waters
Stoke the fire
Smoke and iron
Sound the slaughter

We’re ready for war
We’re ready for war
No stopping us now
No taking us down
We’ll get what we came here for
We’re ready for war
We’re ready for war
No stopping us now
No taking us down
We’ll get what we came here for
We’re ready for war

We’re ready for war
We’re ready for war
No stopping us now
No taking us down
We’ll get what we came here for
We’re ready for war
We’re ready for war
No stopping us now
No taking us down
We’ll get what we came here for
We’re ready for war
We’re ready for war
