You're soul is the fuel to my insanity
There's no one who can do what you do to me
'Cause you'll be by my side when they turn of the lights
And a thousand eyes close and call it a night

Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes

When the winds bring me along
To the place that I call home
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours

Straight from the city that never sleeps
Surrounded by filth and scum moving at my feet
Vibrations from underneath, underneath
Hands behind my back, my back
Facedown, my eyes are open, I'm choking, yeah
I spent my whole life running
I spent my whole life running from something (Something)
But I trust the concrete

Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes

When the winds bring me along
To the place that I call home
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours

They say it's safe to fall
If you just trust the ground that you stand on
So get back up, against them all
Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from

Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes

When the winds bring me along
To the place that I call home
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
