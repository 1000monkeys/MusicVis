Welcome to the panic room!
We're running out of air, ain't seen the light of day
Living life scared so I hide myself away
Chaos all around, be quiet just be calm
I'm better off alone like I have been all along
I don't know why but, I'm trapped inside
Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Panic, panic welcome to the panic room
Like a spider I will crawl, back into my hole
I'm scratching at the walls but I have no where to go
I'm adjusting to the dark, forget about the pain
Am I really that afraid or am I just insane?
Don't know why but you follow me inside
Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Panic, panic welcome to the panic room
Suffocating, I can't breathe
Hallucinating, walls closing in on me!
Panic, panic
Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Welcome to the panic room, it's my dark place
Lock myself away from you and I can't escape
When you've got nothing to lose paranoia sets in
And no matter what you do, I'm never gonna let you in
Panic, panic welcome to the panic room
