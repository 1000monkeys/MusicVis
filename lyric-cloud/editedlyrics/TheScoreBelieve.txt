When it's four in the morning
When it comes without warning
The silence drags you down under the tide
When your whole world is jaded
When your colors are faded
And nothing but your shadow's on your side

I believe in you
I believe in you

If you ever need somebody
Even if all your tiles fall down
If you ever need somebody
Even when all your hope runs out
If you ever need somebody
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you

When your fights fly like arrows
When the way all feels narrow
And the rock you always lean on starts to slide
You feel suffocated
So once celebrated
And the person that you were you cannot find

I believe in you
I believe in you

If you ever need somebody
Even if all your tiles fall down
If you ever need somebody
Even when all your hope runs out
If you ever need somebody
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you

Even in your darkest days
Even if you lose your way, you lose your way
(I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you)
Even when you're feeling ill
Even when you're at your worst, you're at your worst
(I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you)

If you ever need somebody, somebody
If you ever need somebody, somebody
If you ever need somebody
Even if all your tiles fall down
If you ever need somebody
Even when all your hope runs out
If you ever need somebody
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you
Somebody
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you
If you ever need somebody
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you
Somebody
I believe, I believe, I believe in you, in you
