You're a divine intervention
A miracle of nature, yeah
You're everything that I want
But I want is gonna be the death of me

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Boom, boom, boom

You're looking drop-dead fine tonight
There's no question about it
Don't know how much I can take before I lose it all
You make me feel like I mean nothing to you
Because that's the way that I like it
I like it rough
I like it rough
I like it rough

A rockstar on a budget
Still, I would treat you like royalty
But I could tell from the start
That my heart was gonna be your casualty

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Boom, boom, boom

You're looking drop-dead fine tonight
There's no question about it
Don't know how much I can take before I lose it all
You make me feel like I mean nothing to you
Because that's the way that I like it
I like it rough

All that you deserve is running through my blood
(Running through my blood)
And I'd would sever every vein
Just to have you look at me
Look at me


Boom, boom

You're looking drop-dead fine tonight
There's no question about it
Don't know how much I can take before I lose it all
You make me feel like I mean nothing to you
Because that's the way that I like it
I like it rough

I like it, I like it rough
I like it, I like it rough
