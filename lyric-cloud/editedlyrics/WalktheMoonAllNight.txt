Things are changing
Around me but I
I feel the same inside
Getting older
Not getting wiser
It's got me up all night
That everybody
Wants the same things
At the same damn time
Running in circles
Hunting hunters
Hurry up and wait in line

I just want to meet somebody

All night, all night
It's a wild life, and I'm looking for a ride home
All night, all night
It's a wild life, and I'm looking for a ride home

Long hours
'Till the sun sets
And then I call my friends
Wash the dirt off
Button your shirt up
Do it all over again
Can you tell me
Is it really worth it
To stick it out in line?
How will I answer
When I look back
How did I spend my time?

I just want to meet somebody
Are you the one who will take me there?
Are you the one who will treat me right?
I'm not afraid of your blue-est flame
Been burnt before but I'm roaring inside
