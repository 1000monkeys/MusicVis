Yeah, you caught me on a run, on a run
But I won't lay low
I move heaven in the earth just for you
If you said so

Oh I need you now
There's no way out, for me
So if the stars go south
Or the sun falls down

I'm gonna steal the moon, for you
Yeah, I'm gonna steal the moon, for you
I'm gonna steal the moon
I'm gonna steal the moon

I hit you right on the rocket to the sky
Just to find you
Is there a power in the whole universe
I wouldn't break through

Oh I need you now
There's no way out, for me
So if the stars go south
Or the sun falls down

I'm gonna steal the moon, for you
Yeah, I'm gonna steal the moon, for you
I'm gonna steal the moon, for you
I'm gonna steal the moon, for you
Yeah
