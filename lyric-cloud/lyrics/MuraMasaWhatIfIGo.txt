Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
I will and I must, oh
I definitely wouldn't miss a thing
When you're lost on your own and you're wondering
If I'm following
Just know wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe

Luck of the draw
You, that's my lottery won
A gem in the rough
I could be your finishing touch
So wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe

Go, going, going, oh
Go, going, going, oh
Go, going, going, oh
Go, going, going, oh

And is it really like this
See your likeness, shining brightly through a haze
Of little slings and arrows, smoke and mirrors
Blue and icy, meet my gaze
Boom, my heart bursts, light with blood loss
Slow to get up, hard to save
You fill my head with madness
Good and bad, don't be the one who got away, got away

Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
And every night spent without your face has me shuddering
I colour my words in a violet shade to hide the pain
And you go solo no longer, I be, I be there for sure

Luck of the draw
You, that's my lottery won
A gem in the rough
I could be your finishing touch
So wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe

Go, going, going, oh
Go, going, going, oh
Go, going, going, oh
Go, going, going, oh

Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
Wherever you go
I'm going with you babe, going with you babe
