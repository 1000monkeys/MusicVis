Here I am again
Floating through the silence in my cold skin
Our bodies wearing thin
My fears tell me I'll never win
Our bodies wearing thin
Wearing thin

And there's darkness here (darkness here)
The whole world I fear (I fear)
In my room I seem to drown (to drown)
But I won't let them take me down
I won't let them take me down
I won't let them take me down, down, down, oh

I won't let them take me down
(Down, down, down, down, down)
I won't let them take me down

I'll rise and I'll fall again
Fighting off the violence in my cold skin
Our bodies wearing thin
My fears tell me I'll never win
Our bodies wearing thin
Wearing thin

And there's darkness here (darkness here)
The whole world I fear (I fear)
In my room I seem to drown (to drown)
But I won't let them take me down
I won't let them take me down
I won't let them take me down down, down, down, oh

I won't let them take me down
(Down, down, down, down, down)
I won't let them take me down
