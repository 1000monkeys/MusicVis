I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets

What a way to drop a bombshell baby
Guess you really didn't think I'd found out
Hear the silence crying
In the room on the side with the lights out
Know what you're feeling, oh-oh
Know what you're feeling, oh-oh

Fuckin' with my heart and head
(And again and again and again and again)
Fallen out of love again, yeah
(And again and again and again and again)
Rollin' up my blunt in bed (In my bed, in my bed, in my bed, in my bed)
Fallen out of love again
It's been a very, very long night
Sittin' with my girls, sippin' wine like

I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-oh


Oh, oh
I'ma have to take a mugshot, baby
What you're doin' to me is criminal, out here
On my knees, I'm prayin'
In the room on the floor with the lights down
Clothes in the kitchen, oh-oh-oh
I'ma light it and leave it for you

Fuckin' with my heart and head
(And again and again and again and again)
Fallen out of love again, yeah
(And again and again and again and again)
Rollin' up my blunt in bed (In my bed, in my bed, in my bed, in my bed)
Fallen out of love again
It's been a very, very long night
Sittin' with my girls, sippin' wine like

I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-oh


I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
