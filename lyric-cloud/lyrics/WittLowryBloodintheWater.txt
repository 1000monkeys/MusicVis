Yeah, I don't fit in boxes or your categories
You won't find realer or the next us
"The chosen one," might get it tatted on me
You passed on me, better fess up
On my worst day, could make your best stuff
All my worst stuff could be your best-of
And your runnin' mouth better rest up
There's a couple of things I kept pent-up, uh

I've been alone in my room with nobody around just to gather my thoughts, yeah
Your album is chartin', not a surprise, now tell me how many you bought, yeah
You met with a label one time and you posted some pictures, I see your facade, yeah
I met with some labels, no pictures from me, I paint pictures with words when I talk
People talkin', I got no time to listen
You're tryin' to be different, that makes you not different
They say I just rap about women
That's comin' from lames who just never get women
The best is a given, y'all average
Honestly, for a second, I forgot I was a savage
Took passion, somethin' all of y'all lackin'
Man, askin', "Is anybody not actin'?"
'Cause I know I'm the only one
I know, I know I'm the only one
We have a lot to cheer, so they pour me one
Only one can judge, that's the Holy One, yeah

I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anythin' honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anythin' honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now

That's keepin' honest, who'd you copy after?
Erase Your Socials, I own my masters
I'm a trendsetter to you trendin' rappers
I would mumble too if I was rappin' backwards
I would mumble too if I was just a puppet
Talk about my dick and how these bitches love it
Never had a filter, never one to fuck with
Told me turn my sound to know whatever's buzzin'
I was taken back, told 'em, "Fuck that"
They're in love with money, they don't love rap
Tried to show love, get no love back
Never play me, that's a fun fact
And your album sounded like one track
I don't see a ceiling, I'm above that
Want to see me fall, they would love that
Is anybody else bringin' love back?
I know I'm the only one
I know, I know I'm the only one
We have a lot to cheer, so they pour me one
Only one can judge, that's the Holy One, yeah

I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anythin' honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anythin' honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now

Opinions from people that never get it
You buy every lie that they're sellin' to you
You stole my style, never gave me credit
You would buy my story if I'd sell it to you
Remember back, I was surfin' couches
My new estate got a fuckin' fountain
A middle finger for a fuckin' doubter
I keep it deep enough to watch ya fuckin' drownin' now

I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anythin' honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything' honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
