Dance
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in Mojitos, bullets and banditos
Matzo balls in soup, jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
Count it off on the hook
Let's go
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this

The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in Mojitos, bullets and banditos
Matzo balls in soup, jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
