I thought, I saw her brought to life
She was warm, she came around and she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
Well, I couldn't be that man she adored
Don't seem to know
Don't seem to care
What your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore
There's nothing where she used to lie
The inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake so I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
It crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake so I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
So torn
There's nothing where she used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on this floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake so I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
This is how I feel
So torn
