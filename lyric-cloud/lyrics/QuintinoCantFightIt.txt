You only come and go when you feel like it
Been at it for a while, but you won't commit
This inconsistent love is messin' with my head
(Love is messin' with my head)
(Love is messin' with my head)
And it just ain't fair
You know I can't fight it (I can't fight it)
Wanna put my hands
All over your body
Oh, and if the stars don't shine
Yeah, and if the moon fell down tonight
I would be there no matter what
I wanna be the one to make you fall in love
Make you fall in love
Make you fall in love
I wanna be the one to make you fall in love
(I wanna be the one to make you fall in love)
(I wanna be the one to make you fall in love)
I told you how I felt right before you left
Been at it for a while like a cigarette
I know that I should quit, but I'm not ready yet
Oh no, no, no
And it just ain't fair
You know I can't fight it (I can't fight it)
Wanna put my hands
All over your body
Oh, and if the stars don't shine
Yeah, and if the moon fell down tonight
I would be there no matter what
I wanna be the one to make you fall in love
Make you fall in love
Make you fall in love
I wanna be the one to make you fall in love
(I wanna be the one to make you fall in love)
(I wanna be the one to make you fall in love)
