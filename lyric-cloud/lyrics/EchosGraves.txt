Bodies in your bedroom that I've never seen
Poison on your fingers like kerosene
Everytime I see you I light up inside
But truth is casting shadows all over me

I see the way you walk through your house
Like a ghost, hollow bones
You're fucking empty
I could see the grave you built in your sheets
I hope you lie in your bed thinking of me

There's a hole inside my chest, you can't see
You're the air inside my lungs I can't keep
And I try to tell myself you want me
But I can't keep holding on

There were funerals in my blood that you couldn't see
My head's a burial ground of your memory
But it keeps replaying, got nowhere to hide
When I saw you leaving with her
Oh, it opened my eyes

I see the way you walk through your house
Like a ghost, hollow bones
You're fucking empty
I could see the grave you built in your sheets
I hope you lie in your bed thinking of me

There's a hole inside my chest, you can't see
You're the air inside my lungs I can't keep
And I try to tell myself you want me
But I can't keep holding on

Exit through my chest with your silhouette, love
You can take what's left with your fucking problems, oh
Exit through my chest with your silhouette, love
You can take what's left with you

There's a hole inside my chest, you can't see
You're the air inside my lungs I can't keep
And I try to tell myself you want me
But I can't keep holding on
There's a hole inside my chest, you can't see
You're the air inside my lungs I can't keep
And I try to tell myself you want me
But I can't keep holding on
