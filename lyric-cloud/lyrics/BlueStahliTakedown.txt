Takedown!

I break through
What you view
Just to counteract
Kamikaze crash dive when I fight back
Whatcha' gonna do?
Whatcha' gonna say?
When I wipe the smile right off of your face

Right now
Break out
Takedown

I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you’d make a beautiful suicide

Don't speak
Doublethink
Who you push around
You're mistaken
If you’re thinking that I'll back down
Whatcha' gonna do?
Whatcha' gonna say?
When I give back all the hate you made

Right now
Break out
Takedown

I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you'd make a beautiful suicide
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you'd make a beautiful suicide
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you'd make a beautiful suicide

Ill!
