Sipping on a bottle of gin
No, I'm sipping on a bottle of loneliness
Feel a little faded again
I gotta climb out of this bottle of loneliness

And I'm trying
And I keep on climbing
There's nothing here for me
I gotta climb out of this bottle of loneliness

Longing for my lover again
Yes, the lover that I traded for loneliness
Tried to drink away all my sins
Now I'm trapped inside this bottle of loneliness

But I'm trying
And I keep on climbing
There's nothing here for me
I gotta climb out of this bottle of loneliness

So I'll never stop trying
And I'll never stop climbing
There's something here for me
Outside of this bottle of loneliness
