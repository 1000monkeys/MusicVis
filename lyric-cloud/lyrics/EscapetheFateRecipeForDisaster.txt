I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm a recipe for disaster

I guess I'm having myself one of those days
I itch so deep that I scratch until I bleed
I am built on destruction with no fear of repercussions
Approach it with caution

I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm the murderer's happy ever after
You should stay away
Or you'll have hell to pay
I'm a recipe for disaster

I'm a recipe for disaster
No follow motherfucker, I'm the only master
I won't stop even though I should
I can't help myself 'cause it feels so good
This world did this to me
Though I avenge myself through blasphemy
Fuck me, I'm pissed, so fuck you
I'm the monster you made, it's so nice to meet you
I don't play well with others, proceed with caution

I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm the murderer's happy ever after
You should stay away
Or you'll have hell to pay
I'm a recipe for disaster

Bite your tongue before I cut it out, cut it out
Bite your tongue before I cut it out
Bite your tongue before I cut it out, cut it out
Bite your tongue before I cut it out

I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm the murderer's happy ever after
I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm the murderer's happy ever after
You should stay away
Or you'll have hell to pay
I'm a recipe for disaster
I'm a recipe for disaster
