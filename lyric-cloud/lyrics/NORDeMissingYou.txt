Ain't no lesson lesson learned, I'm still here trying
To get you out of my mind, trying to leave this behind
Got all these answers, but I know I'm lying
When I say we're all good, 'cause I know that I should

Try to let you go, try to act so cold
Faking confidence, I'm way ahead, no
But after all the things that we've been through
I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you

Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you

Got all these messages, but I keep hiding
You got me searching for signs, out of touch, out of line
Now, the reasons fade why I keep writing
But I don't know what to do instead

Try to let you go, try to act so cold
Faking confidence, I'm way ahead, no
But after all the things that we've been through
I'm still here missing me, missing you

Ain't no lesson lesson learned, I'm still here trying
Got all these answers, but I know I'm lying
Ain't no lesson lesson learned, I'm still here trying
Got all these answers, but I know I'm lying
Ain't no lesson lesson learned, I'm still here trying
Got all these answers, but I know I'm lying
Ain't no lesson lesson learned, I'm still here trying
Got all these answers, but I know I'm lying

Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you

Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
Oh, I'm still here missing me, missing you
