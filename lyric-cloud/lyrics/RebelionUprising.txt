I consider myself to be merciful
As a queen
When it comes to my politics
I’m wonderful, they agree
I can’t please everyone
That’s a fact you’ll have to face
When there’s will there’s a way
But I can put an underdog back in their place
There will be no revolution
Uprising, rebellion, or revolt
But your passion is admirable
There will be no revolution
There’s safety in power and control
Your compliance is just deplorable
Listen and do as I say
Submit, surrender, and behave
Do you think you’re being brave?
Comply to my will and
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Hit me with your best shot
There will be no revolution
Uprising, rebellion, or revolt
But your passion is admirable
There will be no revolution
There’s safety in power and control
Your compliance is just deplorable
Listen and do as I say
Submit, surrender and behave
Do you think you’re being brave?
Comply to my will and
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
Obey, obey, obey
