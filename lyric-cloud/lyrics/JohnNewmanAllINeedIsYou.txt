Fire
Time to burn the flame all through the night
Time to bring my dark chain into light
Oh yeah I’m fighting, fighting, fighting to be free
Stronger
Stronger than the man I used to be
Time to reign the golden age for me
Oh yea I’m fighting, fighting, fighting to be free

And all the chances I take
All the changes I make
Yea, they’re only nothing

‘Cause all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
I go to war with these troubles
And really all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)

I’m
The rising force that you will never tame
The glowing cause that you will not contain
Oh yeah I’m fighting, fighting, fighting to be free

And all the chances I take
All the changes I make
Yea, they’re only nothing

‘Cause all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
I go to war with these troubles
And really all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)

All I need is you!
Alright, alright
All my love, all my love, all my love for you

‘Cause all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
I go to war with these troubles
And really all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)

I need, I need… is you
(All I need is you, all I need…)
(All I need is you, all I need…) is you
