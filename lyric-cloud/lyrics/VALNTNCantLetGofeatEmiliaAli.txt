Stick around just like cigarette smoke
Like a dream, I fell asleep but I never woke
They say you bad, but I just can't let go
You get me high like cocaine, make my heart race
You got me hooked, need you even more the next day
I know you're there, but I just can't let go
Got me addicted, my head and heart conflicted
First you get me high and then you see your other mistress
I know you're  there, but I just can't let go
Can't let go
But I just can't let go
When I feel down, you take me to a good place
You touch me right, I close my eyes and we just fly away
I know you're bad, but I just can't let go
Always go back every time you come around
But I know as soon as you leave, I hit the ground
I know you're there, but I just can't let you go
Got me addicted my head and heart conflicted
First you get me high, and then you see your other mistress
I know you're there, but I just can't
Can't let go
But I just can't let go
