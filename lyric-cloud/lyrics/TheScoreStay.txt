I've been lying to myself at night
Thinking everything is alright
Yeah, I get lost in this state of mind
Losing my words got me, got me, got me tongue-tied
Doubt myself and I don’t know why
I wish I wasn't this person sometimes (Times, times)
I make mistakes but I think it's just fine (Fine, fine)
It’s just fine
And I tell myself

Stay who you are
Don't be afraid
When it all comes crashing
Stay who you are
Don't be afraid
Stay

I'm so tired trying to walk the line
Just to measure up, I'm done trying
Yeah, I get lost in this state of mind
Losin' my way every, every, every time, I
Doubt myself and I don't know why
I wish that I could be perfect sometimes (Times, times)
I make mistakes but I think it's just fine (Fine, fine)
It’s just fine

When it all comes crashing, stay
Who you are, don’t be afraid
When it all comes crashing, stay
Who you are, don't ever change

Stay
Stay
Stay

Stay who you are
Don’t be afraid

When it all comes crashing, stay
Who you are, don't ever change

Stay
Stay
Stay
