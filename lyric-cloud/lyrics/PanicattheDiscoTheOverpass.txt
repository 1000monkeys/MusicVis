Let me hear you say somethin'

Sorry to get sentimental tonight
(That perfume lingers in your hair)
It's just that everything reminds me of things
I thought I shouldn't have to see again
See, the thing is I'm so sorry to say
(You need me, don't you?)
Someone still loves you (still loves you)
Someone still loves you

Meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna
Let me hear you say somethin'

I have a shirt that keeps your smell
(That perfume lingers in your hair)
You keep one too in parallel
(You keep my long black leather)
See the thing is I'm so sorry to say
(You need me, don't you?)
Someone still loves you (loves you)
Someone still loves you

Tiny bottles of shit wine
In a tin can that climbs
But I remember every time
Everything about you is perfect
Down to your blood type
But I remember every time

Meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna
Let me hear you say somethin'
