I was thinking about the day we met
And the love came rushing out and you were empty-handed filled with regret
I was thinking about the day we met
When the love came rushing out and you were empty-handed filled with regret

Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out
Our love is running, running, running out
Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out
Our love is running, running, running out

I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carry me away with just a look into your eyes

Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out
Our love is running, running, running out
Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out
Our love is running, running, running out
