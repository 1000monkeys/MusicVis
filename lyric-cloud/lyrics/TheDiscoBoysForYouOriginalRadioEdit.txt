I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
Princess cards she sends me with her regards
Oh barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted
To her Cheshire smile I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted
You let your blue walls get in the way of these facts, honey
Get your carpet baggers off my back
Girl give me time to cover my tracks
You said, "Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks"
But they're not what I came for
Oh I came for so much more
And I know you that too
And I know you know that's true
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
For you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
For you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
For you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
For you
I came for you
