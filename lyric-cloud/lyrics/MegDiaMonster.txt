His little whispers, "Love me, love me!"
That's all I ask for, "Love me, love me!"
He battered his tiny fists to feel something
Wondered what it's like to touch and feel something

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

That night he caged her, bruised and broke her
He struggled closer, then he stole her
Violet wrists and then her ankles, silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Time will hear their voices, I'm a glass child
I am Hannah's regret

Monster, how should I feel?
Turn the sheets down, murder ears with pillow lace
There's bath tubs, full of glow flies
Bathed in kerosene, their words tattooed in his veins (yeah)
