In these days of thunder
In  these years of rain
We  are the future
We kill the vain
In these moments of anger
In  these hours of fear
We  are the future
We will remain here
We  are the future

And if you step into his world in his mind
You will see it quickly change into a beautiful, exciting world of fantasy
We are the future

In  these days of thunder
In these years of rain
We are the future
We kill the vain
In these moments of anger
In these hours of fear
We are the future
We will remain here
We are the future
