If pictures tell a thousand words then this is a speaker gallery
Where the attention you pay is a meager salary
Little kiddy’s pissed cuz he’s different, made him wiser
So people sleep on him like his spit was tranquilizer
The kids a crazed macguyver, he can stitch a phrase with wires
And spit the blazin fire that can make the stage a timer
Until he blows up and becomes the greatest rhymer
Dynamite in the flesh I suggest you take his lighter
Plus he’s getting flak for rappin' witty
Because he lacks a half a milli and a fucken' track with diddy
About cash, ass and titties so hes feeling trapped in cities
Rappin for every asker and half these naggers picky..pssh
Im just chillin on this green planet player
Bugged out on trees like a leafed mantis prayer
Drawin on some bleached Sanskrit paper
Bump this in your car tunes, beat animator
CHORUS
Monkey see and Monkey do
What he wants with the world that’s in his hands
And he walks like a badass
Ands he’s about to put the globe in his backpack x2
This is hell where the devils get cold
Streets made of sulphur and ghetto brimstone
A fellowship of rebels hit the yellow brick road
Rip the heart from the oil mans metal tin bones
But shit you niggas probably never get close
So I'm lazy like a river with this effortless flow
Coming from underground where the sediments shown
The pressure on the seeds make em never get grown
I don’t give a fuck like a celibate ho'
Cuz' everybody’s a pessimist yo' on some bitchy shit
Idiots
They just simians with heat rays
History has given us the lineage of D Day
Fee payed by the cityslicker cheapskates
Where them piggy’s whisper “get that shitty nigga keep aim”
Trickyness and street fame
Ill spit a friggin' flood till the mermaids skinnydip in sea waves
CHORUS
Monkey Face is the style that I choose, nigga
You couldn’t walk a mile in my shoes x3
Monkey face is the style that I choose
And you couldn’t walk a mile, couldn’t even smile
