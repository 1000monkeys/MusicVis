Oh, ain't nothing you can tell my heart
To make it untrue, I've fallen for you
Yeah, ain't nothing gonna stop what we started
Cause all I do is think about you
Oh, ain't nothing you can tell my heart

What's this thing you've done?
You've put a spell on me, magic on my tongue
Don't you tell no one
Nobody else can know what we've become

Cause I can't let you, but I can't do much about it
I'm burning up a fever, feeling like a seizure
Can't let you go, but I can't do much about it
My heart's beating like a steel drum tryin' to fight the rhythm

Oh, ain't nothing you can tell my heart
To make it untrue, I've fallen for you
Yeah, ain't nothing gonna stop what we started
Cause all I do is think about you
Oh, ain't nothing you can tell my heart

Ain't nothing they can say
Don't make me change the way

What's this dream I'm in?
Ain't nothing I can do to forget your kiss
Leave  in the mirror
Just keep driving 'til we're far, far away from here

Cause I can't let you go, and I can't do much about it
Let's put the fear behind us, dive into this new love
Can't let you go, and I can't do much about it
Let's surrender like a victim, let my body give in to you

Ain't nothing they can say
Ain't nothing they can do

Oh, ain't nothing you can tell my heart
To make it untrue, I've fallen for you
Yeah, ain't nothing gonna stop what we started
Cause all I do is think about you
Oh, ain't nothing you can tell my heart
