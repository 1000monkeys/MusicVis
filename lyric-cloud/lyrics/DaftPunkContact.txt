Hey, 
Bob
I'm looking at what 
Jack
 was talking about
And, uh, it's definitely not a 
particle
 that's nearby
It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing
It's way out in the distance
Certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion
Because the flashes come around almost on time
As we look back at the earth, it's up at about 11 o'clock
About, uh, well, maybe 
ten or twelve diame...Earth diameters
I don't know whether that does you any good, but there's 
something out there
