They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
I can't see them anyway
No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your hand
I am losing sight again

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
I will stay unless I may
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way
[Chorus: Ben / 
Syd
]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I have a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left
So, save your breath
Lying in wait
Caught inside this tidal wave
Your cover's blown
Nowhere to go
Holding your fate
Knowing that I will walk alone

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
I will stay unless I may
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way
[Chorus: Ben / 
Syd
]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I have a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

You wanted it back
Don't make me beg

Don't make me beg! Enough!
Die! Blow me away
[Chorus: Ben / 
Syd
]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I have a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all
