I'm gonna hit you
Right where it hurts
I'm gonna give you everything that you deserve
If you need attention
Something to say
Let's hear your confession, I am just too hard to break
Bring it
Bring it
I'm still right here undefeated
Say whatever you want
It really don't mean anything
Bring it
Bring it
If there's no fear let me see it
There's nothing you got
That will ever get to me
Your words are reckless
Delusional
Inside you're helpless, far from who you say you are
You try to push me
Over the edge
I won't let you, pull me down to your level again
Bring it
Bring it
I'm still right here undefeated
Say whatever you want
It really don't mean anything
Bring it
Bring it
If there's no fear let me see it
There's nothing you got
That will ever get to me
Are you ready for this?
'Cause I've been waiting my whole life
Are you ready for this?
I am gonna get mine
Are you ready for this?
I'm taking the hardline
Are you ready for this?
We're never gonna get alive
And now you're here to stare me down
And now you're here to stand your ground
I'll knock you down, I'll drag you out
No mercy
How do you like it now?
Bring it
Bring it
I'm still right here undefeated
Say whatever you want
It really don't mean anything
Bring it
Bring it
If there's no fear let me see it
There's nothing you got
That will ever get to me
Bring it
Bring it (you will never get to me)
Bring it
Bring it (you will never get to me)
Bring it
Bring it (you will never get to)
Bring it (you will never get to)
Bring it
Bring it (you will never get to me)
Bring it
