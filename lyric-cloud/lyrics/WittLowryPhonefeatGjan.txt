Seems you know what I want
My mind is full, it's full of you
It doesn't seem we were right
Another lie, another fight
Now every night, I tell myself
Stop thinkin' about him, you're losin' your mind here
But every time I'm doin' this
Refusin' it, I'm foolin' myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh, foolin' myself

Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see
This love wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
I  tell myself, it's not who I am
Understand it wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone

Hey Mark, I know you're mad, but I thought that maybe you'd answer
So maybe last night was the last time that we'd speak
Remember who was there when your dad was goin' through cancer
Remember who was there when your soul was broken and weak
You see, I took my time with you, you just took me for granted
I juggled with my demons, you never would understand it
So when you said, "forever," I thought about it and panicked
I lied, but when I told you I loved you, I meant it, dammit
I know I was never perfect, and you hated me for it
You say the same shit in your songs and have 'em praisin' you for it
And we would sit and talk for hours 'bout your music and tourin'
And even though you say you loved me, I was less of important
I know, I hurt way more than I show, it hurts way more than you know
I know I cheated, but you cheated us both
Your trust issues tore a hole that me or you couldn't close
We were distant due to distance, was different when you were close
You're different, I hope you know, we argue now over nothin'
I'm goin' out with my friends, all you hear is someone I'm fuckin'
I know you're not gettin' trusted, but cut me some fuckin' slack
I wish that night never happened, sometimes I still play it back
I try to ignore the facts, I'm not the person you thought
Now all that's left are moments and every ticket we bought
Damn, it's all a hard pill to swallow, might wash it down with some shots
So cheers… to what we lost

Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see
This love wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
I tell myself, it's not who I am
Understand it wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone

Hey, uh, I got your message, I guess I just wasn't ready
To be honest, since you left everything is pretty unsteady
To be honest, since you left, I barely eat or get ready
I been tryin' to fill this void with anyone who will let me
And I just hate how now we're stuck inside this game
The loser is the one who shows they care, or feel in pain
I'm checkin' if you took down all our pictures, just so I can do the same
Fuckin' petty, wasn't ready for you to just up and change
And I know that you'll only miss me when you fail to replace
Girl, I lived across the map, how could you need more space?
How could you be so fake? See, I was real from the start
Every lie was like a knife that I took straight to the heart
Don't know who you are, how could I when you lied from the start?
You feel empty, so you fill up every night at the bar
I feel empty, but can barely fill the tank in my car
They love you after 3 a.m., but they don't love who you are
I can't lie, honestly, I still think about you
And when I go out with my friends, I still drink about you
I'm sorry if I made you question how I feel about you
Put you over everything, but now I have to live without ya, oh shit!
I'm drivin' into a tunnel, so I might break up
I promise I would've stayed if there was a way I could save us
If only you spent as much time on us as you do your make up
I tried… and you gave up

Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see
This love wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
I tell myself, it's not who I am
Understand it wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
