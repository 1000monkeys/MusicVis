Asleep in sinking towers
We lost our superpowers
How did it under persuade
Too old to make a change and
Too young to stay the same and
Now I fear it's too late
Is it too late?

I don't belong here
Don't tell me to be strong, dear
Everything is wrong here, look at what we've done
We're guns for hire
The world is catching fire
We keep climbing higher
Too close to the sun
To the sun
Too close to the sun

Adrift from rising waters
Save your sons and daughters
Leave your neighbors behind
Too late to stop the burn (burn)
To whom it may concern (concern)
I'm just tryna survive
To survive

I don't belong here
Don't tell me to be strong, dear (strong, dear)
Everything is wrong here (wrong here)
Look at what we've done (what we've done)
We're guns for hire (hire)
The world is catching fire (catching  fire)
We keep climbing higher (climbing higher)
Too close to the sun (to the sun)
To the sun (to the)
Too close to the sun (sun)

And as I'm falling down
(falling down, falling down)
Falling down, falling down
I'm thinking to myself
Such high hopes we had
And as I'm falling down
(falling down, falling down, falling down)
Falling down, falling down
I'm thinking to myself (I'm thinking to myself)
This is not so bad
And as I'm falling down
(falling down, falling down, falling down)
Falling down, falling down
I'm thinking to myself
(falling down, falling down, falling down)
Such high hopes we had
And as I'm falling down
(falling down, falling down, falling down)
Falling down, falling down
I'm thinking to myself
This is not so
This is not so
Bad!

I don't belong here
Don't tell me to be strong, dear (strong, dear)
Everything is wrong here (wrong here)
Look at what we've done (what we've done)
We're guns for hire (hire)
The world is catching fire (catching  fire)
We keep climbing higher (climbing higher)
Too close to the sun (to the sun)
To the sun (to the)
Too close to the sun (sun)
