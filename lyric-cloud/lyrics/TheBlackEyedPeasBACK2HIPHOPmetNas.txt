So Imma tap you into this, Out to all them hip hop kids, yo it's time to dream big, So Imma take you back quick
Go check the pioneers, not talking about the speakers, it's been going on for years, since rappers delight
Grandmaster Flash & The Furious 5 with the white lines, don't do it, don't do it, this my history lesson use it

Around the time Jay z got his breakthrough, it's a hard knock life, you want the kids and the wife coz all these pioneers taught us how to write

Digging for a 16 in these beautiful dreams, can't forget Rakim, Guru & preem, was into black eyed peas behind the front, was in New Jersey rrolling up philly blunts, now dont get it twisted this hip hop i've lived it, credit where credit's due & forget you too
Goes deeper than the vodoo your polluting on youtube, coz all you new guys ain't really saying nothing new
Baby mama drama & you got a big gang, and that's the message you wanna give the youth, well crack on coz ain't that the truth
Money for misery better joining the military, or the queens armed forces, it's horses for courses wanna run around and shoot
Best polish your boots I put the headphones on lock into the loops, think about your career, this ones Pioneers
Mco got the old school sound, Mco take the old school round, Mco get up to get down, Mco coming to your town
Mco got the old school sound, Mco take the old school round, Mco get up to get down, Mco coming to your town
