FamilyDuncan JonesVery sorry and sad to say it's true. I'll be offline for a while. Love to all
CollaboratorsTony ViscontiHe always did what he wanted to do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life - a work of Art. He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn't, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life. He will always be with us. For now, it is appropriate to cry
Brian EnoDavid’s death came as a complete surprise, as did nearly everything else about him. I feel a huge gap now
We knew each other for over 40 years, in a friendship that was always tinged by echoes of Pete and Dud. Over the last few years – with him living in New York and me in London – our connection was by email. We signed off with invented names: some of his were Mr Showbiz, Milton Keynes, Rhoda Borrocks and The Duke of Ear
About a year ago we started talking about Outside – the last album we worked on together. We both liked that album a lot and felt that it had fallen through the cracks. We talked about revisiting it, taking it somewhere new. I was looking forward to that
I received an email from him seven days ago. It was as funny as always, and as surreal, looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did. It ended with this sentence: ‘Thank you for our good times, Brian. they will never rot’. And it was signed ‘Dawn’
I realise now he was saying goodbye
Carlos AlomarRobin & I are devastated by the passing of our dear friend, David Bowie. To family and friends our deepest sentiments. We are silenced- RIP

Iggy PopDavid’s friendship was the light of my life. I never met such a brilliant person. He was the best there is
Nile RodgersDearest David, your life changed my life. Love forever
Brian MayI woke up late, after a long night, to shocking news. David Bowie gone.
I don’t know if I can react immediately.
He was a fearsome talent, and the loss to Music and Culture from his passing is inestimable.
In and out of our lives, always challenging and innovative, and … shocking.
But this news is hard to take in.
I had no idea he was close to death. Would like to have said something …
Very sad. Sincere condolences to his family.
But what a life.
All hail, David Bowie, Star Man, Hero. RIP.
Roger TaylorDavid Bowie: The cleverest and most interestingly brilliant man of our time. What a vacuum he leaves, and how he will be missed.
Mick JaggerDavid was always an inspiration to me and a true original. He was wonderfully shameless in his work. We had so many good times together. He was my friend, I will never forget him.
LuluAt the news of David Bowie's death I feel a deep and profound sadness. I send my heart felt condolences to  and his children for their loss
Win ButlerGoodbye friend. So many tears, and so lucky to have passed in the same solar system
Pete TownshendWoke up to the awful news that my lovely friend David Bowie passed away. I am so deeply sad, but he just completed a radical and audacious new album, and that is a great thing. Personally I am grateful to him for doing it.
For those who were his fans he was a charismatic and exotic creature and still gloriously beautiful even as he approached 70. But face to face he was funny, clever, well-read, excited by the arts, and really good company.
In a Japanese restaurant we once ate tiny live crabs sent over to our table by a businessman fan. David said we must try, out of courtesy. I wouldn’t have done it with anyone else on the planet. Delicious, of course.
He was simply a joy to be around, so good at making everyone feel at ease. I’m sorry to hear it was cancer that got him. I knew he had been ill for several years but didn’t know the details. My thoughts now go to his family and close ones, and to so many of his fans who will be beyond distraught today. We have lost a monumental figurehead of the British arts scene. We have also lost a wonderful clown whose combined sense of mischief and creativity delightedly touched our hearts. David Bowie was my Salvador Dali. He was also one facet of my perfect Ace Face.

Lady GagaRetweeted Twitter user @clodaghmcginley: "In all honesty, Gaga as we know her would not exist without David Bowie"
Yoko Ono LennonJohn and David respected each other. They were well matched in intellect and talent. As John and I had very few friends we felt David was as close as family.
After John died, David was always there for Sean and me. When Sean was at boarding school in Switzerland, David would pick him up and take him on trips to museums and let Sean hang out at his recording studio in Geneva.
For Sean this is losing another father figure. It will be hard for him, I know. But we have some sweet memories which will stay with us forever.

The Mountain GoatsDavid Bowie's music, over the years, has meant more to me than I can say. We have lost someone who imparted comfort and strength to us.
Adam LambertBowie was one of the bravest artists of the century. A true Icon. I love how Bowie challenged people's perception of gender stereotypes and what an Outsider truly was. He was SO ahead of his time
Scooter BraunWoke up this morning to this legend being gone. I can't think of how many times I have referenced him in conversations or in turn had an artist do the same. He was living breathing artistic greatness. He will be missed but his art will live forever. Thanks for it all. #ripdavidbowie

David Bowie was someone who people of my age, and those quite a bit older, felt we grew up with. He provided a soundtrack to our lives, from the first time I heard Space Oddity to the pride of welcoming British athletes at the London Olympics to one of his masterpieces - 'Heroes'
He was also a master of reinvention, who kept getting it right, leaving a body of work that people will still be listening to in a 100 years time. He was someone who truly deserves to be described as a genius
