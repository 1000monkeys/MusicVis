Cold as a valley
Where I lay my head
Cold as a woman
In another man's bed
Down in the forest
With the devil in me
I'll remember the looks on their faces
Through the sycamore trees

Ain't no chariots of fire
Come to take me home
I'm lost in the woods
And I wander alone

Hellfire, hellfire
Take my soul
I'm waiting, waiting
I'm ready to go
(Yeah)
Mothers, children
Lock your doors
I'm waiting
I'm ready to go
(Yeah)

Run in an alleyway
Through a dead end street
Murdering promises
That I just can't keep
We could sing pretty melodies
On the unmade bed
Slow-dancing to a silhouette
Cause I ain't dead yet

Ain't no chariots of fire
Come to take me home
I'm lost in the woods
And I wander alone

Hellfire, hellfire
Take my soul
I'm waiting, waiting
I'm ready to go
(Yeah)
Mothers, children
Lock your doors
I'm waiting
I'm ready to go
{DJ scratching}

Hellfire, hellfire
Take my soul
I'm waiting, waiting
I'm ready to go
(Yeah)
Mothers, children
Lock your doors
I'm waiting
I'm ready to go
(Yeah)
