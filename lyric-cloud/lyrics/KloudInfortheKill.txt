We can fight our desires, ooh
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot, ooh
Whether we like it or not

They say we can love who we trust, ooh
But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions, ooh
But what are feelings without emotions?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
I'm going in

I'm going in
I'm going in (going in)
I'm going in
I'm going in for the kill

They say we can love who we trust, ooh
But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions, ooh
But what are feelings without emotions?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
I'm going in

I'm going in
I'm going in (going in)
I'm going in
I'm going in for the kill
I'm going in
I'm going in (going in)
I'm going in
I'm going in for the kill

Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I hope in darkness we can see
And you're not blinded by the light from me

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

I'm going in
I'm going in (going in)
I'm going in
I'm going in for the kill
I'm going in
I'm going in (going in)
I'm going in
I'm going in for the kill
