Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night
Ola, ola, ayy (Through the night)
Ola, ola, ayy (Through the night, yeah)
Ola, ola, ayy (Yeah)
Ola, ola, ayy (Sweet dreams)

Oh, right (Ayy)
Now everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
You home tonight babe, babe (Oh, yeah)
Dashing through the night

Dashing through the night
Dashing through the night

I wanna get into motion
A better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin'
You know what I'm sayin'
Now everything will be alright

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night
Ola, ola, ayy (Through the night)
Ola, ola, ayy (Through the night, yeah)
Ola, ola, ayy (Yeah)
Ola, ola, ayy
Dashing through the night

Dashing through the night
Dashing through the night
