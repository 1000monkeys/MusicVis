Looking at the city lights
It's cold tonight, it's cold tonight
Like a dream, like a star
It’s in your eyes, it's in your eyes

We never sleep
We keep the blood pumpin' through our veins
We always meet the fear head-on
Where the shadows lay

Step into the darkness
If we’re gonna save this city
The darkness
If we’re gonna save this city
Oh, oh, oh
I can hear it calling
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I can hear it calling

Vanishing from the start
Right under us, right under us
Empty hands, empty hearts
Wanderers, lost wanderers

We never sleep
We keep the blood pumpin' through our veins, yeah
And we always meet the fear head-on
Where the shadows lay

Step into the darkness
If we’re gonna save this city
The darkness
If we’re gonna save this city
Oh, oh, oh
I can hear it calling
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, I can hear it calling

Yeah, I can hear it calling
Yeah, I can hear it calling


Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I can hear it calling
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, I can hear it calling
