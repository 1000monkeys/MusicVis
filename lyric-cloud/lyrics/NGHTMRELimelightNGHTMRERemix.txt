When you wake up, call a cab
Cos we ain't telling anybody 'bout us yet
And you want all of it
But you ain't even got the guts to tell your friends
I want your lips in public
But we both know the world ain't ready for that yet
So take my hand in secret
Take my heart and put it in your pocket

I want the limelight with you
Want the world to see you're mine
We shine like diamonds in the view
Take the world out for a ride
Take the world out for a ride
Take the world out for a ride

We make love in darkness
Not even when you show up we won't confess
Shedding off our midnight skin
But I still feel your touch upon my fingertips
You say my name, you keep me safe
But only when you know no one can hear a thing
So whisper plans, make promises
And tell me that one day I'm gonna' be your queen

I want the limelight with you
Want the world to see you're mine
We shine like diamonds in the view
Take the world out for a ride
Take the world out for a ride
Take the world out for a ride
