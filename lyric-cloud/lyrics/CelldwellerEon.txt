(Now I'm pushing, I'm pushing)
(I'm pushing through)
(I'm pushing through face)
I'm pushing through facedown!
I'm pushing through facedown!

I'm pacing inside this empty room
Told to wait til my life's withdrawn
Uneasy, I'm waiting here anxiously
It's a waste and I won't wait another eon

Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
I'm pushing through
Facedown and pushing through

Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I can't feel anything

Erasing my final memories
They won't stop til my whole life's gone
Uneasy, I wait for normality
It's a waste and I won't wait another eon

Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
I'm pushing through
Facedown and pushing through

Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I can't feel anything

When life is gone without a trace
And hope is lost in time's embrace
I won't wait or hesitate
Cause I'm pushing through facedown!
I won't wait or hesitate
Cause I'm pushing through

If time's a song, I won't wait for its reprise
I am done wishing farewells and goodbyes
I won't let this place overshadow my
Birthright, I won't wait another eon

(Impatiently)
Impatiently-y-y-y
I'm cutting through the earth in front of me
Bone on stone, blood and sweat married
Can't hear the voice that whispers fears when my heart is pounding in my ears
All I see in my mind(-i-i-ind) is not what I've left behind
But all the things I've been missing in that lost eon

Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through

Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I am lost inside this dream
When I can't speak and I can't scream
And I can't feel anything

Facedown and pushing through
