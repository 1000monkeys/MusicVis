How many times can you go through the pain
Just when you think it's cool, the shit hits the fan
Tomorrow brings the same old sun, but never shone our way
Ain't it a drag babe, ain't it a drag babe, oh what a drag babe
You're telling me, you're telling me
I took the last plane out just to see the pretty view
Try to hold on to the edge, to see what you would do
Tomorrow brings the same old sun, but never shone our way
Ain't it a drag babe, ain't it a drag babe, oh what a drag babe
You're telling me, you're telling me
You go your way, and I go mine
We'll never meet, until the next time
Tomorrow brings the same old sun, but never shone our way
Ain't it a drag babe, ain't it a drag babe, oh what a drag babe
You're telling me, you're telling me
(Ain't it a drag, ain't it a drag)
Ain't it a drag (ain't it a drag)
Ain't it a drag (ain't it a drag)
Ain't it a drag (ain't it a drag)
