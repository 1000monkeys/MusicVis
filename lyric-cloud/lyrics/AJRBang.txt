I get up, I get down, and I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still 
I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride, but I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! 
Here we go!

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
, let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang, let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

Feel like I'm gonna puke 'cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang! 
Metronome:
Man, I'm up to something (Up to something)
Ooh-de-la-di-do, thank you all for coming (All for coming)
I hope you like the show 'cause it's on a budget (On a budget)
So ooh-de-la-di-do, yeah, come on, here we go, yeah
Come on, 
here we go!

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (Come hang), let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (Come hang), let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang)
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang, bang)

Been a hell of a ride, but I'm thinking it's time to go
So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song
Everybody come hang, let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! 
Here we go!

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (Come hang), let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang)
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (Come hang), let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Here we go!
 (Bang, bang)
