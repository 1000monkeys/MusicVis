And I know that we just met
I love the way you take it off
Wanna break down all your walls
And you're taking off
The memories we made
I'll hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you

Did you enter my life or whatever, forever
Feelin' like you could do better
Better than me, I'm wishing OT
Wishing you stayed but today is the day that you leave
As you packing your bags, I'm watching you leave
Reading back over your letter to me
You got tears in your eyes, you can't hide it from me
Both our noses are running, we're fighting to breathe
And I'm looking in the mirror like Mark
Got a cold heart how'd it get this far
How'd it get this hard? Never letting anybody in
Now you're spilling your feelings all over the car
Europe is feeling like mars
Both of us know that I shoot for the stars
Check through your baggage you're packing a piece of my heart
Knew it was over before it could start
Damn, now all that I see are the memories
That me and you could achieve in a short time together
A reason to season forever, you came in and left like the weather
Both human, no less and no better
Remember the moment I met her
Forgive me for making you wait for my letter
I'm writing this song cause I told her I'd never forget her, and I know

And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
Wanna break down all your walls, wanna have it all
And now you're taking off
The memories we made, I hope you save
I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
Wanna break down all your walls, wanna have it all
And now you're taking off
The memories we made, I hope you save
I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you

And I think I lost me while I tried to find you
Remembering back to the night that we met
Came to my show and you stayed for my set
I'm puking and spillin' all over my chest
Sometimes I admit I'm a mess
I fuck other rappers, you fuck with the best
Care more about your morals than buyin' a dress
Care more about your life than the likes on your breast
I'm fuckin' impressed
See love is something that's been over my head
Or if I'll do it again
And me, I'm no more than a tourist supporting a friend
I care 'bout the time that we spend
I don't wanna pretend
Tryin' to find the line that defines
If you're more than a friend, it's funny
They say times is money
When time is the only thing that we don't spend, I did it again
I build up a wall with a tight rope to my heart
And I hope you don't fall, we've been through it all
I sit here and wait for your call
But settling down I don't think that we're ready at all
I'm busy I'm chasing a passion
Looking back and asking how did this happen
And how is it now that I found all the feelings I'm lacking
A tourist of time and our time isn't lasting, and I know

And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
Wanna break down all your walls, wanna have it all
And now you're taking off
The memories we made, I hope you save
I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
Wanna break down all your walls, wanna have it all
And now you're taking off
The memories we made, I hope you save
I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you

I don't wanna watch you fly away
I don't wanna watch you go
Tell me where you stay
I don't wanna watch you, wanna watch you
Fly away
