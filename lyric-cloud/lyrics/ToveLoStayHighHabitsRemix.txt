Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh, ooh

Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Oh, ooh

Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
To keep you off my mind
High
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
To keep you off my mind
Oh oh, oh oh

Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh ooh

Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Oh ooh

Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
To keep you off my mind
High
All the time
To climb too high
All the time
