No money, no money left any more
Life's nothing, life's nothing we can't afford
It's unbelievable, what people will believe these days
It's unbelievable, the prices i am willing to pay

Close your eyes are we, living the dream
Close your eyes are we, living the dream

Are we awake, are we asleep
Come on tell me what it really means
Are we enslaved are we free?
Come on tell me what i need to be
Are we awake, are we asleep?
Come on tell me what it means
Are we living the dream, are we living the dream?
"Living the dream"

I'll miss you
Before we turned to machines
We were human
We were such beautiful things
It's unbelievable what people will believe these days
It's unbelievable the choices, i am willing to make

Close your eyes are we, living the dream?
Close your eyes are we, living the dream?

Are we awake, are we asleep
Come on tell me what it really means
Are we enslaved are we free?
Come on tell me what i need to be
Are we awake, are we asleep?
Come on tell me what it means
Are we living the dream, are we living the dream?
"Living the dream"

"What I need"
"Need"
"What I need"
"What I need"
"What I need"
