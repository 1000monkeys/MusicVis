There's a storm, and it's coming
And it's faster than an airplane
You can try, keep on runnin'
But no one can dodge the rain
There's a fire, and it's burnin'
Lightin' up like a volcano
You can try to ignore it
You can try

Hey, did you feel the earthquake?
Did you feel it?
Oh, did you touch the hurricane?
Did you see it?
Oh, how can you just walk away?
Can't you hear it?
Roar, thunder, thunder, roar
Hey, did you feel the earthquake?
Did you feel it?
Oh, did you touch the hurricane?
Did you see it?
Oh, how can you just walk away?
Can't you hear it?
Roar, thunder, thunder, roar

There's a love that we're missin'
There's an ocean of paradise
This is poison we're kissin'
As the thunder bang, bangs the sky
There's a force and it's stronger
Than any strength of you or I
There's a love
There's a love
Thunder, thunder roar

Hey did you feel the earthquake?
Did you feel it?
Oh did you touch the hurricane?
Did you see it?
Oh how can you just walk away?
Can't you hear it
Roar, thunder, thunder, roar


Hey did you feel the earthquake?
Did you feel it?
Oh did you touch the hurricane?
Did you see it?
Oh how can you just walk away?
Can't you hear it
Roar, thunder, thunder, roar
