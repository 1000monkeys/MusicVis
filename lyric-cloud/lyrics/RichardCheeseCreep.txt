Spoken:
You know folks, I was talking with my honey the other day, my Pablo Honey, I said to her, I said, "Pablo Honey", I said, I said, "You go to my head...my Radiohead."

Sung:
When you were here before
I couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so frickin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the heck am I doing here?
I don't belong here
No, no, no, no!
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I'll have that special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the heck am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I'm a creep, I'm a nutjob
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here...
I don't belong here
Fitter, happier, more productive, comfortable, not drinking too much, a pig in a cage on antibiotics!
Thank you!
