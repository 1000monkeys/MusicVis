It's hard for me to say this
Without sounding impatient, and I know you know
You know how we can fix it
Just tell me and I’ll listen, seems easy to me
Instead, I'm tryna pick up on the signs
Read between your lines
To see what's going on
’Cause it's weighing us down

Right now, you seem unhappy
Can't we just talk it out before I go?
Instead, you wanna wait until I'm coming home
Oh, I know that you won't let it go

Let's solve this situation
With simple conversation before it grows
Grows into something bigger
Let's see the bigger picture and let it go
But first, let's try to talk about what went wrong
Then talk about moving on
We both feel better off
When we smile when I leave

So when you seem unhappy
Can’t we just talk it out before I go?
Instead, you wanna wait until I’m coming home
Oh, I know that you won't let it go

I’ve been wrong (I've been wrong), I've been right (I've been right)
But we’re both gonna lose if we fight (If we fight)
I'm still yours (I'm still yours), you're still mine (You're still mine)
If we fight, let me fight as the one by your side

And if you seem unhappy
Can't we just talk it out before I go? (Can't we talk it out?)
Instead, you wanna wait until I'm coming home
Oh, I know that you won't let it go
You seem unhappy
Can't we just talk it out before I go?
Instead, you wanna wait until I'm coming home
Oh, I know that you won't let it go
