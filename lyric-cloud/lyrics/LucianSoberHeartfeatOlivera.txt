We knew it all along
How to end this love song
I know it's scary on our own
But we're gonna find new flow

Back to the start
Don't wanna dance to this song anymore
Read the story on the clothes on the floor, on the floor
Don't say aloud, we'll get it from the silence around
I am yours and you're my only crowd, only crowd

Let me sober up
Let me face the minutes over and over again
You see: now it's locked, my sober heart is beating now
It's about to burn out, let me sober up
Let me face the minutes over and over again
You see: now it's locked, my sober heart is beating now
It's about to burn out

I miss the feelings around it
Now it's cold and all blue
I'm gonna keep on reminding
I always will be there for you

Don't close the door
We're losing what we fighted for
It was one of a kind, that I'm sure, that I'm sure
Don't say aloud, we'll get it from the silence around
I am yours and you're my only crowd, only crowd

Let me sober up
Let me face the minutes over and over again
You see: now it's locked, my sober heart is beating now
It's about to burn out, let me sober up
Let me face the minutes over and over again
You see: now it's locked, my sober heart is beating now
It's about to burn out
