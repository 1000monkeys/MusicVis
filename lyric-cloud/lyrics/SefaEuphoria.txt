Baby, lately
You hate me but that I understand
Getting harder to ignore that
I really need to get some, really need to get some

Under summer
I'm flying high above the ground
But that's okay, I'll land someday
Really need to get some, really need to get some

Euphoria

I'm so sick of feeling tired
I've had enough, baby
Take some time to work it out
Really need to get some, really need to get some

Euphoria
