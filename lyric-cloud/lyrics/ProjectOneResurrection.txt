The project must live on
The project must live on
Project One
Those that stare into the abyss
Will see a perfect reflection of the universal mind
Revealing the mysteries, of space and time
They have died the death of stars to become one with the one
And so, they were reborn, for the project must live on
The project must live on
They have died the death of stars to become one with the one
And so, they were reborn, for the project must live on
Project One
The project must live on
Project One
