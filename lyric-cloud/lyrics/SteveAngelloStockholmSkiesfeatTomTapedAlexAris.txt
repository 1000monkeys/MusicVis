A sovereign wind
I've never found before
The state I'm in as
I washed up on the shore
I've never been so ready
I've never felt so steady
A sovereign wind
I've never seen before
In the Stockholm skies
It's you and I
The path is not who you are
Just let it go, tonight
When this leading light delights
You're onto something right
In the Stockholm skies
It's you and I
In the Stockholm skies
Just you and I
In the Stockholm sky
The path is not who you are
Just let it go, tonight
When this leading light delights
You're onto something right
In the Stockholm skies
In the Stockholm skies
It's you and I
In the Stockholm skies
It's you and I
In the Stockholm skies
Just you and I
In the Stockholm skies
