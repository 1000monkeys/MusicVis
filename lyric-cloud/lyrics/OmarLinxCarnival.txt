Now this is M.O.R
It's that 'Oh my God'
You can see it in my future like a tarot card
I'm like a whole world apart
I'm a goddamn star
They be like 'Damn LinX, never thought you'd go so far'
Well thank you
Wait, fuck you
Why would I ever trust you
Sittin' right over top of that web of lies that I cut through
You see I'm nuts too
Spillin' out my guts to
All these fuckin' people that barely care what I'm up to
Losin' my mind
Gettin' juiced to the nine
I got a 40' in each hand
Drinkin' two at a time
I mean I hope they prepare
Before I pull out my hair
I got a screw lose in the attic
Time to pull down the stairs
That's that dope shit, coke shit
Ego swole like a blow fish
Time that someone admit that I'm nothing short of explosive
Y'all just some vultures
Feedin' off my emotions
Nobody get familiar
I'm gettin back to my old shit

(??) Life is such a carnival
You laugh, you play, you die
You're on your own
Selfish hypocrite making dough off my penmanship
I'm out here venting
Writing this is like my medicine
Watch me create it
Invent it like Thomas Edison
I'm bringing down the house
And it's their mistake that they let me in
Let's just be honest
Only fuck with the finest
Tellin' y'all I'm the sickest
It's sounding more like a promise
Let me decide when you destined to die
The time is now
Listen piggy
This Lord of the Flies
I guess you tried
You talk a lot but I guess you lie
They got no spine
I pay no mind
I just let 'em hide
You know I get it
Don't care about who offended
I probably should be commited
No wonder they lookin' timid
Humble yourself
You're finished
People sick of your gimmicks
Cookie-cuttin' these cowards
Let's push this all to our limit
You're not alone
You oughtta know when you gotta go
They fall like dominoes
Damn baby I'm on a roll

(??) Life is such a carnival
You laugh, you play, you die
You're on your own
