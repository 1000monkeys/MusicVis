Take a moment for yourself
Get close with the lights down low
You and I and no one else
I get the feeling that i wanna explode
Baby you grap my attention tention burning, Fever high
Take me to another demention
Tonight the rules do no apply
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, Lets have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on Overdrive
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, Let's have passion
Boy, You've got my heart on Overdrive
This is where I wanna be hands up, feel the base in my heart
Give me faith and I will leave
I take the risk cause you're never to far
Right now I'm drowning in emotion
Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, Lets have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on Overdrive
When my head is spinning, All hands to the ceiling
I begin to come alive
Overdrive (Overdrive)
