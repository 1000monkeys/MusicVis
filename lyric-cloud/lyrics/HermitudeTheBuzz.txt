Do you feel, feel
Feel, feel?
Do you feel it in the air, air, air, air?
Do you feel, feel?
Do you feel, feel?
I can feel it in the air, air, air, air, air, air, air

Do you feel the buzz or is it just me? Trust me
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
You call it a clean break
Do you feel the buzz, baby?
Do you feel the buzz?


Do you feel it? Do you feel it in the air?
Is it just me?
Do you feel it? I can feel it in the air
Is it just me? Is it just me?

Do you feel the buzz or it's just me, just me?
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
I can't even see straight
Do you feel the buzz, baby?
Do you feel the buzz?


I said, do you feel the buzz?
