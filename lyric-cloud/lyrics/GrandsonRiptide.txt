I have done bad things, did them to good people
Got no self-control, it's the root of my evil
Wage war in my head when I'm tryna keep it peaceful
A little feels good, a little more and it's lethal
Save me from myself

I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
These bad habits, they die too slow
I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
But if you love me, let me go

I get high to leave all these problems on the ground
Then to my surprise, they're right there when I come back down
I do it like I've done before, a million times
A million and one and I lose my mind
Save me from myself

I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
These bad habits, they die too slow
I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
But if you love me, let me go

But if you love me, let me go

Got pulled by the current 'til I'm runnin' out of breath
Got dragged back down, feel the water in my chest
I've tried getting better, did all of the twelve steps
Who ever would have thought? Who ever could have guessed?
The harder that I chase it, the further that it gets
The harder that I chase it—

I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
These bad habits, they die too slow
I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
But if you love me, let me go

Let me go
But if you love me, let me go
