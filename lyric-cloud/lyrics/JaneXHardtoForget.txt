Oh you know I'm always telling you that you
Don't have me on my knees
But tonight's the night that you were gonna get the best of me
Even though I tell you, "No"
I don't wanna fight and when you pull me close
Baby, I'll play hard to get
But your body's so hard to forget


Baby, I'll play hard to get
But your body's so hard to forget

Baby, I'll play hard to get
But your body's so hard to forget, yeah
