Ooh
Ooh

Something that you don't know
Feel it creeping on me in the night
Weight of it, I can't hold
Pushing me to swim against the

Open tide, open tide
Oh, I fight, oh, I fight

It's not me, yeah
I don't even recognize my heartbeat, yeah
Feel like I'm losing time
Here we go, here we go again
On the ropes, on the ropes
It's not me, yeah
I don't even recognize (Ayy)

(Ayy, ayy)
Ooh (Ayy)
Ooh, I don't even recognize

Always fought my battles
But now you make it hard for me to find
A way out of this storm (Woah)
Follows me above my head

Oh, it rains, oh, it rains (Yeah, yeah)
Darker days, darker days (Oh)

It's not me, yeah
I don't even recognize my heartbeat, yeah
Feel like I'm losing time
Here we go, here we go again (Ayy)
On the ropes, on the ropes
It's not me, yeah
I don't even recognize (Ayy)

(Ayy)
I don't even recognize (Ayy)
Ooh (Ayy)
Ooh
Oh, getting me down, getting me down, oh

So tell me something that I don't know
Let's break the chain and learn to let go
I need you to show me, I need you to
Please tell me something that I don't know

It's not me, yeah
I don't even recognize my heartbeat, yeah
Feel like I'm losing time
Here we go, here we go again (Yeah)
On the ropes, on the ropes
It's not me, yeah
I don't even recognize (Ayy)

Feel like I'm losing time (Yeah)
Here we go, here we go again
On the ropes, on the ropes
It's not me, yeah (Hey)
I don't even recognize
