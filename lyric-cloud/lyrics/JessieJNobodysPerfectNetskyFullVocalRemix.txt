When I'm nervous, I have this thing, yeah, I talk too much
Sometimes I just can't shut the hell up
It's like I need to tell someone
Anyone who'll listen
And that's where I seem to fuck up
Yeah, I forget about the consequences
For a minute there, I lose my senses
And in the heat of the moment, my mouth starts going
The words start flowing, oh

But I never meant to hurt you
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love like I wanna be loved
**
Now / I'm / hurted / this / is / so bad / hurting / hurted
I wanna be loved
'Cause/ Now / I'm / hurted / hurting / hurted
'Cause nobody's perfect
Now / I'm / hurted / this / is / so bad / hurting / hurted
I wanna be loved
'Cause/ Now / I'm / hurted / hurting / hurted
'Cause nobody's perfect
Now / I'm / hurted / this / is / so bad / hurting / hurted
I wanna be loved
'Cause/ Now / I'm / hurted / hurting / hurted

I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken
So,Don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect
'Cause nobody's perfect

If I could turn back the hands of time
I swear, I never would've crossed that line
I should of kept it between us
But Jessie went and told the whole world how she's feeling, oh
So I sit, and I realize
With these tears falling from my eyes
I gotta change if I want to keep you forever
I promise that I'm gonna try

But I never meant to hurt you
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love like I wanna be loved
This is a lesson learned

I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
*Let you down* (I let you down)
*And I feel so bad about it* (I feel so bad)
*I guess karma comes back around* (It comes back around)
*'Cause I'm the one that's hurting* (Yeah)
*And I hate that I made you think* (I hate that I made you think)

*'Cause nobody's perfect*
Whoo!
