Uh, WSTRN season
Nah, we don't need a reason
You already know we the meanest
So we gotta hit 'em up with the remix
[Verse 1: Akelle Charles & 
Louis Rei
]
Glove box, one shot, she told me I could make her love drop
She done what? No, you don't even know where we come from
Must not, she's a badders
Had me damn locked, come watch, come down, baby
I'm like, oh boy,
 no noise
She's dealing with a dope boy,
 no point
Shit, I heard you move with them man,
 so moist
They ain't got the music men got,
 sold joints, 
sold joints
I could make your love come down, yeah
Oh, make your love
, make your love come down (
Down
)
Baby, I've been waiting for you
I've been on you since I saw you
Love come down

I don't wanna be without you, baby
Ain't no other girl can make me stray
Make your love come down
Oh, baby
I don't wanna leave and make you miss me
One phone call it takes is all
For you, my love
Make your love come down

Yeah, love come down
You can bring your circle and love comes round
I'm now dancing on ice, I was a cheapskate
They say you're living in hell until you deflate
Let it go, let it go, more money, more problems
I'm made for the better flow, don't say that
It's my birthday in June, I want a Maybach
To celebrate that, got lynched and now my chain hangs
Yeah, so let the good times roll
She said she wants a gent, there's one that books my shows
Don't write my name on lists, write my name in lights
You can get attached to a hook I wrote ironically
So if you're the one that I wanna be with
We would've had chemistry and biology
I can make your love come down
Cause I'm DMC, all I need is Run Town

I don't wanna be without you, baby
Ain't no other girl can make me stray
Make your love come down
Oh, baby
I don't wanna leave and make you miss me
One phone call it takes is all
For you, my love
Make your love come down

Forget our dilemmas, you should come down to my place
Ride with me, let me figure out your mind state
It's hot in here, well, I can turn that woo ice age
It was just a dream, now you're my bae
My bae, my wifey
Valentinos for Valentine's, yeah, they're pricey
I know we say the right things but you ain't nuttin' like me
We both know you look much better beside me
Yeah, well let me know, let me know
I lost a tiny bit of pride, but I'm not letting go
Your mum think you an angel, you at mine on the low
You don't drink but I can make you wine on me slow, yeah
I know your friends tell you don't
Tiller said exchange, I'm praying that you won't
It's the hardest thing ever tryna fix a heart that I broke
It's been a while since we spoke, I'm here living off O

I don't wanna be without you, baby
Ain't no other girl can make me stray
Make your love come down
Oh, baby
I don't wanna leave and make you miss me
One phone call it takes is all
For you, my love
Make your love come down

I could make your love come down
Pull up outside like "love, come down"
Let's go for a ride in the new ting
Now she getting up close when I'm zooming
Look good when you ain't even done up
Made mistakes, didn't even use a rubber
She know we started from the bottom of the gutter
Talking love come down, but I know she love come-ups
You know it's real when she take off the mac for you
Got the candles lit and she wax for you
And she on her own ting, and don't gold-dig
Even though you balled with the patch for you
She said she wanna walk down the aisle with me
I said "when you're ready, we can go Asda"
LOL, she replied "banter", smile for the camera
Make you fall in love with a gangster

I don't wanna be without you, baby
Ain't no other girl can make me stray
Make your love come down
Oh, baby
I don't wanna leave and make you miss me
One phone call it takes is all
For you, my love
Make your love come down

I can see it in your eyes, you've got sex on your brain
When you see the god, put respect on my name
Straight up approach
You heard I'm a player, well, you can be the coach
But I don't wanna be a player no more
But she don't want an average Joe
Always on point when the cameras show
Can't cook but she make a good sandwich though
I-I just give and go
What you talking 'bout, Willis? Different strokes
I told her keep her heels on
But when I take my shoes off, she gon' feel it in her toe

Oh, you
Let me not pretend I don't want you, cause I do
Oh, you know you make my love come down
Ain't no time to wait, I know you feel the same
Make your love come down
