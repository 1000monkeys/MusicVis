This is the final come and go
I keep fighting faith 'cause I don’t wanna know
On this eve in fall, lights shining over
She’s colder than she would show
I guess I’ll just take the pill
And fall into the meadow
This isn’t who I am I’m a soldier with a medal

All my gold turned to glass
And now I’m breathing fast
I need someone to help these hard times pass
All my gold turned to glass
And now I’m breathing fast
I need someone to help these hard times pass

Find someone to help these hard times pass
So let me put my costume on
I’ve gone a million miles
With the same crooked smile
And I always give you all you need

But I can see that you’re dancing with the devil
So I hope you brought your shovel
You won’t get what you need
If you’re not down on his level
And it’s okay just a little mischief
Hotel rooms were made for this
I’ve got you open like a butterfly
Inside you made my soul cry
All day all night for my lifetime
Just a little mischief, mischief

All my gold turned to glass
And now I’m breathing fast
I need someone to help these hard times pass
All my gold turned to glass
And now I’m breathing fast
I need someone to help these hard times pass

Find someone
Find someone
Find someone to help your hard times pass
Find someone
I am someone
Find someone to help your hard times pass

All my gold turned to glass
And now I’m breathing fast
I need someone to help these hard times pass
All my gold turned to glass
And now I’m breathing fast
I need someone to help these hard times pass

Below my feet were steaming coals
And now I’m filled with holes
I need someone to help these hard times pass
If all your gold turns to glass
They find you breathing fast
I am someone to help your hard times pass

Find someone
Find someone
Find someone to help your hard times pass
Find someone
I am someone
Find someone to help your hard times pass
