Fireflies,a million little pieces
Feeds the dying light,and brings me back to
Life
In your eyes I see something to believe in
Your hands are like a flame,your palms the
Sweetest pain
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost,feel the tempature
Rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I Ingnite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby tell me One More Beautiful Lie
One touch and I Ignite
One touch and I Ignite
One touch and I Ignite
So alive your touch is like the daylight
Burning on my skin,it turns me on again
You and i,survivors of the same kind
But were the only ones dancing on the sun
Let the darkness lead us into night
Let our dreams get lost,feel the tempature
Rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just
Tonight
We're monumental tremers that can freeze
The speed of life
Just like particles thats falling from heaven
All over the stars
I hear you calling for me, hear you calling me
Home from afar
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature
Rise
Baby tell me One More Beautiful Lie
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
