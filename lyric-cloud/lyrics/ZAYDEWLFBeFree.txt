Late at night we stumble through the city
Acting like we know where to go
Standing there in the shadows looking pretty
Like your eyes have been laced with gold

We are the lost ones
We are the ones that will always roam
All the time we feeling trapped and guilty
Making deals the only way we know

We're coming alive
Coming alive

Everybody
Everybody wanna be free
Everybody
Everybody wanna be free
Free as we'll ever be
Everybody, Everybody wanna be free

I can tell that you running hot blooded
Way you talkin' with that razor tongue
But that's the way you keep my heart jumpin'
Like the animals we've become

We are the lost ones
We are the ones that will always roam
All the time we feeling trapped and guilty
Making deals the only way we know

We're coming alive
Coming alive

Everybody
Everybody wanna be free
Everybody
Everybody wanna be free
Free as we'll ever be
Everybody, Everybody wanna be free

We've got this feeling in our soul
We've got the reason in our bones
We'll never ever let it go
No, we won't let go
