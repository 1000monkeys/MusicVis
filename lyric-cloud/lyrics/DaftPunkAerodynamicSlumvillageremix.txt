Speak to the hand, I'm Martin, You Tisha Campbell
Tired of livin' this life everyday it's a gamble
Puttin' pieces together that don't even assemble
Feelin' like somebody I don't like but I resemble
I'm so sick up in here and it's time to make moves
I try to blow caps in everything I do
My life is a shame I'm tryin' to just get through
I'm movin' through the trenches
With my mike and my crew
What am I 'posed to do? I got to keep goin'
Shit is happened for me I'm not even knowin'
The storm has passed and yet the flowers still growin'
Still makin' moves, right now shit is on'in
I see a glimpse of life that shines in my face
Warmness in my heart takes me to another place
See right now what I want I can achieve
All I have to do is stick to myself and believe

Where you at, uh-huh
(To all my street niggas makin' money, make it happen ya'll)
Where you at uh-huh
(To my ladys doin' your thing, do it you're the best girl)
Where you at, uh-huh
(To all my Daft Punk people, makin' it happen, keep it movin', let's do it ya'll)
Where you at, uh-huh
(Uh, everybody, everybody ya'll)
Where you

Don't make no sense, the way we are
Niggers can't get a chick (chick) without a car
Anybody ask me (me) I been the star (star)
Always knew that one day (day) I would go far
Some of these rap niggers they need a rain check (check)
I don't understand how they got a mic check (check)
Get your head right, true, you look a wreck
And in the mean time we gone get the pay check

You know, no we ain't the ones to judge
But uh, there's people out here
Who are really puttin' it down, and that's real
You know, Slum Village, can't even do our thing
Make it happen yo (tss) like this

Where you at uh-huh
(To my niggas down for the struggle, keep it up baby)
Where you at uh-huh
(My nine to five niggas, street hustlers, roll-the-dice niggas)
Where you at uh-huh
(To all my chicks tryin' to get the paper, keep doin' that)
Where you at uh-huh
(See everybody makin' moves, don't stop keep it all)

You fled Babylon of life and death on a tattered arm
From the drunk who staggered home
To the destructive atom bomb, set to detonate
You wonder why I write so graphic
When here bullets shatter light poles into white snow fragments
It's catastrophic that you picked up on it like an antenna object
You either find your hustle or demand your profit
Instead in the land of plot and schemin'
Cause today's microscopic
Do bifocal fiber-optics
My friends die with suit and ties inside of boxes
Flip me out when you hit the ground like a fightin' ostrich
But life is just a pair of dice droppin'
In mid stumble
A precious jewel you seclude when you in the struggle

Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you
