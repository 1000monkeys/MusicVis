You got me losing all my innocence
With every look my heart so vacant
Oh, holy ghost
Oh, baby you bring out the devil inside me
And when you sing your lucid lullaby
You take me straight to lover's paradise
When you get close
Oh, baby you bring out the devil inside me

Bring out the devil inside me

Devil inside me
Devil inside me

Losing myself in all the things you do
Visions that we could rule the world
The valleys to the mountaintops, oh
Heaven or hell, it's all the same to you
But promise me this will never die
Holding on for life

You got me losing all my innocence
With every look my heart so vacant
Oh, holy ghost
Oh, baby you bring out the devil inside me
And when you sing your lucid lullaby
You take me straight to lover's paradise
When you get close
Oh, baby you bring out the devil inside me

Hey hey hey heya hey heya
Hey hey hey heya hey heya
Hey hey hey heya hey heya
The devil inside me
Hey hey hey heya hey heya
Hey hey hey heya hey heya
Hey hey hey heya hey heya
The devil inside me
The devil inside me

Devil inside me
Devil inside me
