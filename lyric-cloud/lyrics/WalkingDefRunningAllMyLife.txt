I’m so ready this time
I’ve been running all my life
I hate all the things you do
I gave up everything for you
You got to help me, help me grow
Let me out before I’m old I said
Let me out before I fall
Before I
You running all (x11)
You running
I’ve been running all my life
I’m so ready this time
I’ve been running all my life
I hate all the things you do
I gave up everything for you
You got to help me, help me grow
Let me out before I’m old I said
Let me out before I fall
Before I
Before I
Before I fall
You running all (x11)
You running
I’ve been running all my life
I’m so ready this time
I’ve been running all my life
I hate all the things you do
I gave up everything for you
You got to help me, help me grow
Let me out before I’m old I said
Let me out before I fall
Before I
Before I
Before I fall (x5)
