I've got a bad feeling about this

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
There was an irritating bellend called Jar Jar
But, hey, that's a tale I'll tell another day
Maybe, the fourth of the month when the calendar is May
Hell, anyway, Cal Kestis
How can I stress this?
A restless redheaded lout with a death wish
So, you can intuitively work out what the rest is
But you're not coming aboard if you're not down on the guest list
Ready for the reckoning and rucking with the Second Sister
When he's finished, she won't need a medic
Better get a solicitor, this Inquisitor is in for such a kicking
Her condition will be similar to syphilitic symptoms

I've seen the truth in visions and the future's misery
You need to be used to fugitivity
Hidden in the dim gloom of the periphery
Of which you've been reduced to trickery
And if you're moving through here, do it invisibly
To reduce possibility of them clocking your activity
But, damn, this is still preferable to captivity
Look at how the Sith have eaten into reality's fabric
The Dark and Light Sides of the Force are more than just magic

I got a bad feeling about this
We're the heathens and demons surround us
I got a bad feeling about this
Though we're concealed, any reason could out us
Why is it treason for needy and helpless people
To stand up to evil that shrouds us?
I got a bad feeling about this
Now, come and have a go if you're feeling rebellious

So, battle on and power on, my Padawan
Hide in the disguise of the life of a silent vagabond
The Light Side shines brighter from the shadow
Songs tell of a Paladin that will rise and take Malice on
Tyrannical monsters set to rights
By the remnants of the Jedi Knights
Who fight with dead-eye sights, loyally led by lights
Holding their head high, pride amid the dread
Tide rising up to where life dies
I said the Lightsaber might save your life later
Bright blades slice through iron cages like paper
To evade annihilation will require the kind of mind-state
It takes to fight Vader
Entire nations slain in far greater pain
The Dark Side is apartheid by nature
If you like danger, taste the fine flavours
Spilling more claret than a giddy wine waiter
No civilized state is recorded being this gory
And the biggest vibrations adorn your Midi-chlorians
So, never let them catch you in the act of using the Force
They'll fake news you, refusing the proof in the source
And when they take you, there's no use in remorse
There's no humanly thoughts
They don't give a two-minute warning
It'll be through in the morning
When your whole region is scorched
They don't even know the meaning of using resonable force

I got a bad feeling about this
We're the heathens and demons surround us
I got a bad feeling about this
Though we're concealed, any reason could out us
Why is it treason for needy and helpless people
To stand up to evil that shrouds us?
I got a bad feeling about this
Now, come and have a go if you're feeling rebellious

Don't stand out, accept the past
Trust no one, trust only in the Force!
The Jedi are not yet lost, hope is not yet lost

Hard choices, start cautious
Can't pause this, Darth Maul shit
Hearts, organs, halved, quartered
Dark forces, Star Wars is stark with the harsh laws
Bow to your lordship or just get out of it now
Come aboard ship
Sick Sith Lords enforcing Order 66
In order that the Order falls forth
Forcing the Force to shift
The authorship of this order sits with Palpatine
It's as if the former law and order all just fell to sleep
I fail to see a system that they won't pursue through
So, if you're forceful, they'll go for you too

I've seen the truth in visions and the future's misery
You need to be used to fugitivity
Hidden in the dim gloom of the periphery
Of which you've been reduced to trickery
And if you're moving through here, do it invisibly
To reduce possibility of them clocking your activity
But, damn, this is still preferable to captivity
Look at how the Sith have eaten into reality's fabric
The Dark and Light Sides of the Force are more than just magic

I got a bad feeling about this
We're the heathens and demons surround us
I got a bad feeling about this
Though we're concealed, any reason could out us
Why is it treason for needy and helpless people
To stand up to evil that shrouds us?
I got a bad feeling about this
Now, come and have a go if you're feeling rebellious
