Hey Lord!
It's A. Ward!
I finally got the battle I- let’s get straight forward
I took this battle cause I knew these fans would be grateful
I took a pay cut and a PayPerView link for the very league that you claim Core'
And then a week after we locked in I found out you ready to back out if King Of The Dot can't pay for it
That’s disgraceful
But that's y'alls business, you needed mo' digits, by all means, go get it
You secured the bag, right? Well I did too and now you finna go in it
This the fight of his life, something he count on scrap
And the first draft heavy, the stout on tap
Your current position in battle rap, let's expound on that
You disappeared, come back, flash your money all around on chats
You gotta stay relevant here, cause Lord knows how he sounds on tracks
MTV went to ya head, this round all facts
You been mediocre ever since Nick Cannon gave you clout on that
So your television appearances don't phase me, that's where his downfall at
Cause you standin' in front of someone who really been out here Wild ’N Out on cats
We are not the same, to be successful my opponents don’t have to be black
Forget yo' witty religious one liners Corey, I can actually rap
But this ain’t Corey, it's Billy Pistolz now how he's packin' his straps
.40 dump-
Bro one Canada square, where you get these stories from?
He told Jimz, "I gotta gun so big it’s 6'9", corny son
I bet the other choppers '6 Foot 7' we don't believe in Corey guns (Cory Gunz)
What you talkin'-
{train goes by the venue}
That bar crazy
Hold up, y'all thought that was a train passin' through the Yard?
Nah, we on a first name basis, see how God already reactin' to my bars?
I'm that nice!
They say I'm a slick talker
Well it's either plead the 5th or back up the talk and spit proper
Flip on ya, ya next family reunion in front of six doctors
Ready to pull the switch on ya, you ain't got guns you got props, you don't lift choppers
Y'all seen Wild N Out, well Charron is so fly
No, no, no I said his soul fly he up there tryin' to rebuttal with Rich Dolarz!
Slow ya role maine
Cause I also said 'Plead The Fifth', 'Talkin' Spit', 'Got Props' and 'Family Reunion', so how I'm beatin' you at ya own games?
They don't watch Wild 'N Out, nobody does
But you a celebrity now, he a celebrity now
Y'all know Nick Cannon made him a factor
Then they cast him as Billy Pistolz in Bodied, he got paid as an actor
Well your life must be a movie, you know there's some other roles that you could've played and they should've cast ya
Like Helen Hunt in Twister since he spent his whole career chasin' Dizaster
I'm that nice
Corey, I'm a different breed
Bars, and I can switch the speed
One minute, you get to free's
Next minute, it's the schemes
Switch to these, need to scuffle
Hit the spleen, he's in trouble
Weave a couple, initially he's seein' double
Sneaky, cause he didn't expect the punch like Mr. Deeds
It's Four Horsemen, this was suicide, see
Move on from all that Matthew, Mark, Luke, John I need you scrutinize me
In every round, hold no punches when you and I speak
Cause against a Horse you (shoe) gotta throw in the ring or end up losin' by three
I'm that nice!
So go ahead rebuttal the Wild 'N Out, the train, all that crap, pretend that you way too clever
It's cool, we about to see the best Charron ever
Battlin' me already made you better

You said all my opponents have to be black, huh, I'm glad you fuckin' noticed
I mean, I really think goin' against white people they're tough opponents
I always lose to white people, Pat Stay, Cruger, 100 Bulletz
I mean yeah, I don't believe in all the hype
Everything he's sayin', I'm not thinkin' that it's tight
You said I only lose to Caucasians, lucky for me that Jesus is white
You've been duckin' me for years
A. Ward, Buddhist Temple (Boot his Temple) 'til he changed Lords
Wage war, duckin', I'm lung cancer in it's late form
I want all the smoke, that's the reason I'm on the stage for (four)
Sharpen the Claymore, I claim more bodies out of Pride than Fedor
If you ever got the chain I would take yours
If you don't think I'd straight jack it (jacket) you must be insane Ward
Is this what you prayed for?
Seein' me is suicide, this what I really do
Bird Box I make you look at me when I'm killin' you
Fuck what you done both years, I'll make this cut throat clear
This ain't Noah's Ark, there's only one GOAT here
And this your number one contender? Don't be a bad sport this the ass whoopin' you asked for
You gettin' washed before your title match, you Head ICE's passport
Yo, who am I scared of?
A. Ward?
A. Ward?!
The guy who's never put money down or won a round from a judge or crowd
And stole his "Run That Back" from the "Slow It Down"
The fuckin' clown who thinks he's a bigger name but can barely break 100 thou'
And praises the man in the sky even though his career's underground?
A. Ward?
Nah, I think this man is Christ
I'm a believer! He made the ultimate sacrifice
It was a miracle, you brought PoRich's career back to life
Do you really think that you're a rapper that I fear?
I hope you beat me, what would happen to my career?
You 3-0 me like you did to Geechi and I win Champion Of The Year?
I got minimum patience, let's have Twitter debate this
All I'm seein' is 1-0, 1-0 it's like a- it's like a- it's like a glitch in The Matrix
R-r-r-remix and shape shift, I got minimum patience
This cat's crossing you again it's like a, it's like a, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
You're a glitch in the system, a defective replacement
I'm the original flick you're a recommendation
Said you'd have P.O. boxed, I'm addressing that statement
Instead we watched Rich bring the house down gentrification
We're both white and do rebuttals, I'm attackin' his faith
This a match made in Heaven, I'll put you back in your place
Do I have to say a prayer so I can battle the greats?
His chance of beatin' me is Slim...Jesus, this a slap in the face
Sorry Ward, this ain't the portrait you want on your storyboard
We're bread different, I'll cement my legacy, Jordan 4
What's a god to a lord of war?
You were fucked when you signed that contract with me, door to door
You do gun bars, are you a Christians rapper or horrorcore?
Top tier, you ain't on Corey's floor
He ain't got strong enough wins (winds) why is he in this category for (four)?
No matter how far you reach, you'll be seen as 4'4"
Go back on Twitter and be an attention whore some more
Rest in peace Bender this is someone to feel sorry for
And I didn't even need to waste, Mormon lord, Hatori's sword
Chloroform,  the Four Horsemen or Dexter Morgan's morgue
We should've waited more and more
I just killed your career before it's born
So maybe now you can finally believe in abortions Ward!
Yo, if this a Duck Hunt, that means dog can't stay on top
Top five, I can't put a word in (A. Ward in) (a warden), my pen game's on lock
The road for your career? I've paved those spots
I've opened doors for you, it's time to change those locks
This for the culture too, these are Quavo's thoughts
Your career can't Takeoff if your talent's not Offset, I get paid mo' qwap
I raised you, time to thank yo' pop
I built you up to break you down, you're a Lego block
Yo 'Ganik, make the stock, Cosby drink, you shouldn't take this shot
Upload the body, raise my stock
American Beauty I want everyone to see this bag I got
Change the plot, this where his faith get swapped
This something your Soul can't handle you facin' Shox
You think I'm afraid? I'm afraid I'm not
I'd rather you take my life than take my spot
Motherfucka!

A lot of regurgitated wordplay in that verse, I'm not sayin' you stealin', but a lot of it's been said before
You know why? Dead it
"Stage for (four)", much better when Gjonaj said it
Then he said "warden" (A. Ward in) much better when Geechi said it
You see me bro?
I'm just lettin' you know, that you gettin' killed out here, I'm lettin' it go
You see I declined two URL's battles and got offered PoRich
I could've easily ducked  ya man
'Ganik, Charles, you two know I don't care about the "who" or "how much", I do it cause I love the fans
My phone ring, I hear the proposal and say "yes", Charron the type to up demands
He almost backed out over 2K, taxin', pointin' fingers like Uncle Sam
But my pen in this battle gonna show why I got the upper hand
I said "two URL battles", ain't that a couple bands?
U2, The Who, ain't that a couple bands?
Ring, proposal, ain't that a couple bands?
You almost backed out over 2K? Now he dyin' over a couple bands
As far as Decade's concerned, I understand, he preferred Jimz, muscle man
So the got Him To The Greek; Russell Brand
But I'm too smooth, I bruise dude, the punches land
Bad kid in the backseat, before we leave you gon' buckle fam'
Core' please, it's hypocritical for dissin' me for obeyin' the Lord's speech
We all saw the K-Shine footage, you was turnin' the other cheek in battles before me!
So miss me with the God things, I wasn't made to sleep on like the box springs
Alshon Jeffery, Saints prevail when I drop things
Ain't an intimidating bone in ya body, stop king
I seen the patterns, what I need security for? You wouldn't lay a finger on a lock screen
Speakin' of fingers, y'all wanna learn how to rap like Corey?
Well this is everything he does to a certain extent
His arms go here, they go here and they go here
And if he gets aggressive his face shakes and he'll curve 'em a bit
{train goes by the venue}
Talkin' 'bout all that God stuff like you know who the gimmick is
Right when I said "shakes" that happened, you know that he's listenin'
His arms go here, they go here and they go here
And if the bars aggressive his face shakes and he'll curve it a bit
So get in position, make sure the rest of your body is nervous and stiff
We're gonna throw in a 'Ganik name drop, a forced multi and a current event
Y'all ready?
Charron'll be like, "He called me out vs PoRich and then he stumbled that evening
'Ganik that just goes to show your up and comers are underachieving
I built this empire with my rebuttals and freeing
Jussie Smollett, you just set yourself up for a beating!"
You are not legit to me, awful similes
Your stock dropped when you decided you wanted to hold Glock pop but lack authenticity
Thoughts are riveting, couldn't drop gems (Jimz) in the ring if you shopped at Tiffany's
I put your league on my back, fought the enemies
To keep it even on both sides; laws of symmetry
So call all your infantry, get your men tore (mentor); Paul & Timothy
I'm on it too, sonic boom, this guy'll (Guile) get all this balled up energy
I'm that nice!
Yo'  is not what's killin' me
Your pen does not appeal to me
You have bottom tier performance and bottom tier delivery
The simplicity of everything you put on that page
Is the very reason why you'll never be mentioned with greats
And so go ahead, rebuttal some more stuff, pretend that you ain't too clever
Battlin' me already made you better

I said, "Ayo it's Charron. Yo! Yo! Yo! It's Charron
That's how I know he's in trouble
He's really scared, he thought I was gonna rebuttal."
Well your style, I fathered you, I really showed you the most
Funny brought up Jussie Smollett, it won't be exposed as a hoax
Cause I have no problem layin' a beat down on an actor and to show him the ropes!
That was CRAZY!

I predicted that. That was written and I predicted that

Finally, I get to battle a virgin, I'm very proud
Casket, get buried now
I just put your in your first box, you can't save yourself for marriage now
You're a little hoe that sits at home reading Twitter polls when a match is out
You type "Ward for the chain" from your spam account
You dick ride every blogger from your Kansas house
These ain't even my bars, I'm just repeating what I heard come out Organik's mouth
And you get religious with your gun bars, you thinkin' that shit's scary
Like, "Ayo, what I got in my left hand is scary. I call this one "God"
Yeah... cause it's imaginary
I gave up gun bars they're really simple
But this isn't Charron it's Sir William Pistolz
Get smacked in the mouth by a chastity belt
I don't fuck around, spit yo' shit
Nah, I'll flip yo' shit this the rebuttal round
Dead that lead clap another round
TEC clap, head rapped, Muslim now
Shoot the blickey cause I love the sound
Bow! Gun 'em down
Headshot who's duckin' now?
And they say "Aaron for the chain"
Why do they root for Ward?
If King Of The Dot was still judged you'd be 2 and 4
Lost to Franchise, Trevor, DNA, 'Rich and the league fucks with you?
You only way you can see me eye to eye is if I keep duckin' you
You only beat Pnut and Cortez, let me humble you
This on sight (site) I took out the URL you don't even have 3 W's
Bitch you want a title shot you not even nice
Tell the Wolf I want the chain, they ain't robbin' me twice
This a Canadian savage, I'd body his life
I ain't 21 Savage I'd never have a problem with ICE
And you claim you're undefeated, your ego is scary
You think you beat that Queens rapper? Bro you got buried
But your people never admit to getting sonned by DNA just ask Joseph and Mary
Admit your losses have some respect
I took an L to Jonny Storm, an L to Cruger, it was a reality check
I lost to Carter Deems and I ain't even battled him yet
You pulled out your phone against Rich that's so wild
9-1-1, what you go dial
Pull out your phone with me, you won't see this Virgin Mobile
You ain't the best pound for pound, I ain't givin' you props
Shroud of Turin, on God we're cut from a different cloth
This American came to the UK, I'll put this botch in a box
Even in Chelsea you wouldn't see this Christian pull a sick victory off
It sounds like Gjonaj tried to lend you his voice
Why would they put a GZ rapper versus a vet that is posed?
I understand Father O'Brien would molest you with toys
But battle rap ain't church, we separate the men from the boys
You predicted your opponent, 'Ganik didn't mention me homie
He just sent you R.I.P. and the devil emoji
You're in a Christian battle group, it's absurd
Picture their group chat when they spit a verse
Like, "That MAC-11 line was even better cause you didn't curse."
I'll rematch you in the states on a different turf
But since you're a Christian that's  you die in Britain first
You buy bars with PrayPal when this guy is in need
Loso pulls up RhymeZone like, "Let me find you a scheme."
You need assistance from Christian's this the guy you believe?
Every verse you're spittin' rewritten more times then the Bible you read
So go ahead Aaron, it's gettin' late
I appreciate you staying out
But wait 'til round three there's something we need to pray about

I said my bars, I like 'em to be lyrical, paint a picture, be very vivid
Let's play a drinking game, when this drops on Youtube I want y'all to take a shot for every setup he had that said "scary" in it
I'm just bein' honest, you said "scary" like five times
"Scary, scary, Mary, scary, scary, obituary", that is trash
Third round supposed to be the closer, right?
Well I'ma put my own twist on it
Watch this, you disconnect yourself from the King Of The Dot community when you got big
And at times it seems these up and comers see you as a hero
They want your advice on battles and for you to watch vid's
So there's no excuse for your disappearance Corey, therefore allow me to hit you wit' a pop quiz
Can you name two GZ battlers that were on Glove Up 2 in Detroit?
What's the yearly event that Chris Wen throws?
Exactly, silence, nothin' he can state for the camera
What's even sadder is the bar before I said, "Times", "Hero" and "No Excuses" I literally gave you the answers!
You trash!
That's what he does! This is what I do!

Spit your bars. Spit your bars. Spit your bars

So no, father son, I ain't tryin' to mimic your steps
You goin' in circles, your career is in a vortex
But let's switch gears, I'm in a tinted Corvette
Nah, scratch that the Jaguar, Leonard Fournette
I'll delimit your immature, minuscule threats
Like I'm undeserving; tennis court nets
Under serving? Tennis court nets?
Scary! But y'all like that scary stuff
Scary, scary, NO!
I ain't tryin' to mimic his steps
You're goin' in circles, your career is in a vortex
Time to switch gears, I'm in a tinted Corvette
Nah, scratch that the Jaguar, Leonard Fournette
I would limit your immature, minuscule threats
Like I'm undeserving; tennis court nets
Under serving? Tennis court nets?
See my pen a sword you merely a beginner course, next!
I need ICE or Chill', I'm tryin' to scrimmage your vets
Cause every element fire, I got Gryffindor's crest
I'm goin' in. You can't rap wit' me bro
How are you self proclaimed King Of The Dot's best?
You not worthy
If y'all Youtube highest views on the King Of The Dot channel, Charron don't got one in the top 30
That's sad, nothin' to laugh at kid
And to put that in perspective for y'all, Dizaster has eight and Pat has six
You are an acquired taste
You are trash for real
All them lines and guess who up here graduated from a Catholic school?
Am I lyin'?
Don't start cryin' in his face
Cause if I am, then 100 Bulletz lied to my face
I said you are trash for real
You graduated from a Catholic school and still don't have mass appeal
I said, "mass appeal" not "massa" chill, you know...
You know you start touchin' on race, we know how you and that works, you get emotional
Charron wears his heart on his sleeve, and we saw that with the confederate flag shirt
Let's get to the facts jerk
You only want to battle cats for rappin' on Smack's turf
King Of The Dot approaches Charron with a match first
Real Deal's down, he says, "No. Ask Twork."
"Ayo Madflex says he's with it."
"No. Ask Surf."
You wanna battle cats known for being strapped with MAC and the iron but won't battle Illmac and then Iron
It's sad
There was another angle I was gonna do, the furnace inspection angle
Cool, no, that ain't worth enough
Because honestly I too have gone door to door to make sure people aren't burning up
And you brought up my whole resume and then you mocked the savior
Well guess what, my battle resume speaks for itself, I got a lotta favorites
Classic Franchise, not The Lakers
I got a great Deal, pocket aces
Love the DNA results, exonerated
Party was a blast, in moderation
Got Cortez out the vault, combination
Then Ark' was necessary, God it's rainin'
I took 'Rich and 21'd him, that's the word on the street
So don't downplay my accomplishments, if anyone deserves this it's me
You dead...but let Billy Pistolz pop off, it's gon' get bold quick
I tell him it's not smart, flip phones tip, he got the options, wish bone pitch
He took the wheel to start runnin'; Flintstone's whip
I punch back to back; Klitschko hits
Then sweep the legs, kick both swift
'Til he get all Billy Spit Yo' Shit!
You question my faith and my content, but my life I put love in it
I see them as lives and purpose
You see them as fans and a paycheck, we much different
You got all these bars and no substance, it's gut wrenching
Any battler can drop the building, it takes a real artist to uplift it
Look I ain't come to get personal witchu
Just know, I brought enough bars to body you and any person that's with you
Aye Dizaster! My Uncle Kleetus and brother Trophy go to church with they pistols!
You can fall in line
Tell 'em God is good
(All the time!)

You said I don't love battle rap, you thinkin' you gonna murder me
You tried to do a pop quiz and think I did it perfectly
Saying I don't know people that try to be on the scene
Well who's this right here? Get up here, I'm sure you heard of me
This guy right here his name is Tierstar, he's killin' shit in Germany
This guy's name, Liam, you know that I can flip this
I love him, he'd still be a part of Don't Flop if Eurgh didn't do bad business
This guy right here? I gotta say shout out to him
This is Oxxxymiron, make some noise for Oxxxymiron
Cause right now I'm deadin' it
This is how I'm doin' it but I'm feelin' hesitant
Don't get too close to A. Ward, right now I'm just questionin' it
Cause a Russian, close to an American? Ain't that how Trump became president?
He said all I do is Bible bars, of course it's true
No one benefits off religion more than you
You posted this caption:
"Hey Lord it's A. Ward
Because of battle rap my vacation paid for."
We know he gets paid off his people's name
He has T shirts made that says, "God is good" and "Jesus saves"
But did that money go to your church? A charity or humans in need?
No, you paid for your wedding off of battle rap, you've been duping the scene
This dudes full of greed
That's a sin
Don't believe me? Revert to the scripture you didn't read
"We do not pedal the Lord's name for profit" Corinthians 2:17
Your whole image is compromised
It's supposed to be "God is good, all the time"
Not "God is good; dollar signs"
You post viral vids, you tweet every month
"Christian rapper kills it and he doesn't cuss"
And you're mad at me for bringing it up?
You say shit like, well not "shit" but like I'm seen all his stuff
I've got an itch to be at the front without relying on words like "itch" with a B at the front
Jesus you suck
We get it, you don't curse so they're evening it out
But when you spell out "crap" when you r.a.p. we can see (C) it's a front
Fuckin' no swearin' Aaron
I think it's great you spell
PoRich made you take an L
Now he is getting two L's back to back you're going straight to Hell
Religions your best crutch you better bless up
Right now Loso's tweeting, "OMG he's getting F'ed up!"
And when my friend died of cancer, was the Lord tryin' to test my faith?
I can kill you right now, but as long as I repent mistakes I can make it to Heaven's Gate?
Confession
Finessing people door to door, was how I was gettin' cake
It's almost as much as a scam as your churches collection plate
Your wedding was funded off of battle rap you should shoot yourself
What? You're gonna walk down the aisle listening to 'Lose Yourself'?
Will Organik be the minister? Will the event be a Prove Yourself?
Like, "Ayo what up? It's Organik. Groom to my left, introduce yourself!"
Do you know Organik is the reason you have clout online?
Does he know about that URL contract you're about to sign?
Facts
They should pay him 30 silver coins for betraying his ass
Where's Moses? Cause I see Aaron's snake in the staff
He showed greed to the ones that invested in him
You battle more than DNA, that's a  gluttony, the lust for attention
And you're obsessed with me, I see the wrath, I see the envy in him
The laziness against 'Rich, the excessive slippin'
You say "I'm nice", that's the pride kept within him
The seven deadly sins embedded in him
You lived backwards, the devil's in him
This isn't a battle Aaron it's an exorcism!
You're not supposed to sell Jesus merch and pay for weddings with 'em
You're like, "I'm a better performer then Charron. I scheme better, but you're forever sinnin'
I get Bible bars to prove you neglect religion
Stop worrying about being the best rapper, try becoming a better Christian
God was NOT good today
And after this, I bet you got an X
Fuck your girl, sloppy sex
And impregnated her, I bet you not impressed
Her period showed up late; Bobby Rex
Let's get it
