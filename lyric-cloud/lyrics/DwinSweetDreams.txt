I got a bible clutched tight, I keep it close to the chest
Next to the crucifix around my neck, strapped to my bed
I'm exorcising these demons that speak straight to my heart
Forced to scratch at the surface, my epidermis is scarred
And holy water no longer seems to burn at the touch
Drinkin' it back the last drops and coughin' up red rum
Fuck the priest, the peace and last but least the beast
It's become an addiction with needs that I can't feed
Without hurting myself, a depraved slave to the devil
Doing his bidding by sinning on a molecular level
Condemned to a life of agony, begging him to be free
He's egging me on constantly, damned but my damn pleas
Fall on def ears in a mirror and it's clearer every day
That I'm staring at Lucifer, I see we're one in the same
So here's the key to my life and the ladder down to the basement
To show you I harbour hell and every cell in it's vacant
(Hook)
Sweet dreams are made of these, memories I buried that'll taunt me when I'm weak
Sweet dreams are made of these, little insecurities that spread like a disease
I'm tormented and tainted, by pain and deranged hatred
Dangerously demented and damaged by temptation
I mutilate myself in search of sexual pleasure
Sever my fucking flesh fresh, slit deeper the better
My white walls run red, drowning I'm stir crazy
And suffering suffocation, trapped but you can't save me
I laugh at the sensation and maybe I need help
I bleed evil, that's why it's cold when it seeps out
And sleeps out of the question, the fuzz on the television's
Hypnotic, so I'm nodding in and out but don't wanna
It causes hallucinations of gruesome abusive faces
Intrudes on a daily basis I'm through with the fuckin' sane shit
It's true that I wait patient for death to bring peace
I pray for it every night right before I go to sleep
Wake up in a cold sweat, blood stained on my sheets
Cuz life is a nightmare and survival is for the weak
(Hook)
Sweet dreams are made of these, rusty razor blades I love when they cut deep
Sweet dreams are made of these, Suicidal fantasies that haunt me in my sleep
Every night I see these pictures, they flicker and pass by
A sick visions, division of a good and a bad side
Torn by the divide, of violent dreams in the mind
Pressing my knees to my eyes, all just to try to survive
And live to see the sun, but it's already begun
Cuz I'm becoming a monster, the fuckin' devil has won
Consumed by hate and revenge, attending sermons that virgins
Serve as pawns on lawns, where they burn crosses in churches
I keep seeing these nurses, battered with blood on their aprons
Being beaten to death by mental hospital patients
Psychotic traumas are triggered quick by repeated exposure
To pornographic content depicting women with rope burn
A sadomasochists punished in submissive positions
Bitches, bondage and latex'll make you beg for forgiveness
So kids with slit wrists, throw up your middle most digits
And show me that sweet dreams are made of our dying wishes
(Hook)
Sweet dreams are made of these
Sweet dreams are made of these
