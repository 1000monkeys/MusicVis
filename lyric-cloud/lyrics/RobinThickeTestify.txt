Yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, love

I was standing on a mountaintop
The sunshine smiling on my face
Breeze was taking me away
It was the perfect day, and everything changed
And I lost my father suddenly
Couldn't keep it together, my family
And all my reckless ways caught up with me
Like the tortoise and the hare
I was sleepin' when I shouldn't be

I come back to you, come back
I come back to you
I come back to you, come back
I come back to you

I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
This love inside, it makes me come back to you
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
Live or die, I always come back to you

I lost my job and it haunted me
Me and my lady lost a pregnancy
And at my lowest, it dawned on me
I'd forgotten who I'm supposed to be

I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
This love inside, it makes me come back to you
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
Live or die, I always come back to you

Broken free from the chains that binded me
Like an angel with brand new wings
I can be anything I wanna be
I can love myself again

Oh, I come back to you
I come back to you
I come back to you, come back
I come back to you

I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
This love inside, it makes me come back to you
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
Live or die, I always come back to you
