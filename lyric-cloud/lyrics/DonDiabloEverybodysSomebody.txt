It's no ordinary life
'Cause we never get it right
No matter how hard we try
'Cause no matter how hard we
We try to be the one
Too proud to get it done
But that ain't gonna beat me
'Cause I already know

Everybody's somebody
And nobody's nobody
Yet everybody's somebody
And all I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody too
Everybody's somebody
Nobody's nobody
Yet everybody's somebody
And all I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you

Is somebody, somebody to you
Somebody, somebody
All I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you

As you try to walk the line
And I struggle to survive
You gotta keep your head up high
Oh, you gotta keep your head high
Don't ever turn and run
'Cause I know what you've become
Yeah, I'd already see you
'Cause I already know

Everybody's somebody
And nobody's nobody
Yet everybody's somebody
And all I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you

Is somebody, somebody to you
Somebody, somebody
All I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you

Everybody's somebody
Nobody's nobody
Everybody's somebody
All I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you

Everybody's somebody
Nobody's nobody
Yet everybody's somebody
And all I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you
Everybody's somebody
Nobody's nobody
Yet everybody's somebody
And all I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you

'Cause I already know
Everybody's somebody
Nobody's nobody
Everybody's somebody
And all I wanna be
Is somebody, somebody to you
