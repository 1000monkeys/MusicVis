I’m the one from the dust
Growing up in a little town
Living life in a flood
Everybody trying not to drown
You and I been up all night
So faded, I ain’t gonna lie
Waking up the wolf inside
Tearing at me like a samurai

Oh we’re here in the jungle
Running right into the fire
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Who’s gonna make it out alive?
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Legends are made from the fire
Yeah this mountain gonna rumble
Tell me who’s gonna make it out alive?

There’s a rhythm in the buzz
Pulse pounding and it’s getting loud
Heavy in the air like blood
Use the pain to keep from blacking out
I’ve been mending my own cuts
Nobody seemed to hang around
But you won’t be the one to judge
I’ll be making that final sound now

Oh we’re here in the jungle
Running right into the fire
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Who’s gonna make it out alive?
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Legends are made from the fire
Yeah this mountain gonna rumble
Tell me who’s gonna make it out alive?


Oh we’re here in the jungle
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Running right into the fire
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Who’s gonna make it out alive?
Oh we’re here in the jungle
Legends are made from the fire
Yeah this mountain gonna rumble
Tell me who’s gonna make it out alive?
