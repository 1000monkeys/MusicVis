Don't wanna get old
Don't wanna die young
I’m buyin’ their cold void satisfaction
Our poison each day, my reason to stay
New feelings in store
Alright gimme more
Alright gimme more
We could have been the ones who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones who turned machines at once
We could have been the ones who left the scene at once
We could have been the ones who took the streets at once
We could have been the ones who left the scene at once
Never gets old, my sad addiction
Letters now bold the saddest fiction
Don’t wanna buy gold, don’t wanna buy love
‘Cuz now it is all sold. There’s never enough
It’s never enough
We could have been the ones who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones who turned machines at once
We could have been the ones who left the scene at once
We could have been the ones who took the streets at once
