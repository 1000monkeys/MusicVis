I am here in our own graveyard
It's a room we used to use
It was lit like summer romance
Now it's dark like winter blues
We became two distant people
We became what we both fear
Now we hide the truth inside us
Hoping it might disappear
Please forgive me
If you still love me
Please forgive me
If you still love me
This is the death of you and me
Our love it changes like the weather
This is the death of you and me
We're dark and cold and not together
Some were never sure
Back when I was yours
And when you were mine
Our hearts were laughing
This is the death of you and me
We were pure like newborn children
Now we're pale like falling snow
We were young and we were dreaming
Now we're older than we know
There were colors in our faces
There was blood and flesh and bone
There was nothing but two bodies
And the war we fought at home
Please forgive me
If you still love me
Please forgive me
If you still love me
This is the death of you and me
Our love it changes like the weather
This is the death of you and me
We're dark and cold and not together
Some were never sure
Back when I was yours
And when you were mine
Our hearts were laughing
This is the death of you and me
We cry and lie and die in the same
Cry and lie and die in the
We cry and lied and died in the same
Cry and lie and die
We cry and lie and die in the same night
We cry and lie and die in the same night
This is the death of you and me
Our love it changes like the weather
This is the death of you and me
We're dark and cold and not together
Some were never sure
Back when I was yours
And when you were mine
Our hearts were laughing
This is the death of you and me
We cried and lied and died in the same night
(this is the death of you and me)
We cried and lied and died in the same night
(this is the death of you and me)
