And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
This is what we're waiting for
This is what we're waiting for

And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
