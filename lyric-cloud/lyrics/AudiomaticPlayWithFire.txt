Ayo, it's DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
This hip-hop thing of ours
Over the last few decades, things have changed
And just like any other movement, nothing remains the same
I respect that
But the one thing that I can't respect is when individuals try to eliminate the original art form and try to rewrite history
Y'all can try all you want, but it cannot happen
Because like everything else in existence
From the dust the culture came, and to thе dust it shall return

Thousand dollar shades on, my lil' homies boost 'еm
Songs bumpin' Houston like Trae tha Truth produced 'em
Silverback nigga, I suggest you get used to him (Uh-huh)
O.G. gangsta (Yeah), now with the beamin' (Woo)
Body in a water shit, I thought that was streamin'
Couple Yonkers niggas, we brought our whole team in (Y-O)
D-Block homicide, look 'em in they faces (D-BLOCK)
Look how many shooters with us, count how many cases

Hardest in the world (Ghost), you ain't gotta ask (Uh-uh)
Way before the quarantine I was in a mask
Ask niggas for six feet, pop 'em in the ass
You rap it like a G, wasn't poppin' on the ave
Hoppin' out the DBS, gettin' to the bag
If you gettin' in my way, then I'm gettin' to the Mag (You know)
True story, it's too gory
Analyze the plug and the things he could do for me, Ghost

Let's go
Anytime I talk, you know the truth spoke (You know the truth spoke)
Any rapper that ever tried me got they boo smoked (Hahaha)
Y'all niggas play these bitches too close
I'm calling plays, he ain't shootin' with that seven like he Kukoč (Brrr)
Change a bitch life when she layin' with a hustler
Had the same attitude when I was playin' with a onion (Uh huh)
Your girl ask for cash, you might hand her a hunnid (What's that)
That's not enough to get a bra outta Banana Republic (Broke nigga)

Say, big nuts and a bigger heart
You a scrub in these streets, I play a bigger part
Better believe that you don't wanna see a nigga start
'Cause you'll be laid up with doctors looking at a nigga chart
Yeah, they got me back snapping necks again
So you better call your family and your next of kin
'Cause when we go to war, nigga, it's like a Mexican
I cut your ass up like carpaccio, nigga, extra thin

Yo, I play with cold stoves so hot it'll break the Pyrex
Yellow and black Wu nice go with the Pittsburgh Pirates
Frozen medallions, they come from Mesopotamia
The Sheikhs carry me in the streets out in Arabia
Tuna fish cans of black hash
Open caskets filled with rifles with Das EFX' mask
Red moccasins, emerald city is my metropolis
I dust rappers, I don't give a fuck what the topic is

You can never win, you're not us, save your best niggas
Me, I'm just invincible, plus I get tough digits
Used to smoke water and dust, hands clutched, nigga
2-0-19 Range look like a bus, nigga
 the Chef is on ill levels
Be the custom ill bezel
We get down, all the hills meddle
Real rebels that run through the real ghettos
Get money and chill, dollar bill rap gangsters, those my real fellows

Rambo rap renegade rebel
40 cal ammo when they clap to spray devil
Bandana up if you double, won't play your borough
Can't avoid George Floyd 'til the case is settled
Baseless devils, empty out and replace the metal
Face the treble, when it's bass, we raise the levels
Love it, get it and think nothing of it
Make amends, then make it public
We ain't to fuck with

Rollin' 50 deep, bloodhound hound dogs with sturdy teeth
The apex predator, wolves huntin' a herd of sheep
Revolutionary philosopher with superb mystique
Curriculum of a college professor with the urge to teach
Overrated ungrateful parasite undeservin' leech
Shove the barrel right in your mouth, you don't deserve to speak
The Ku Klux Klan killer, bury him in the Earth beneath
Drown him in gasoline, light the fire and burn they sheets

Yeah, I'm a survivor, it's not a mystery (Nah)
Even when you makin' the shot, it's still a miss to me (Yeah)
I'm C.T. Fletcher, mixed with a little Mr. T (Uh huh)
You on The Shade room, just hoping that you don't miss the tea (Haha)
Beam to your chest, I swear that I won't miss your Tee
Scream to the refs, "He flagrant, how could you miss the T?"
The fifth degree, I could flip your Vee
I call my stick Moses, I split your waves in half like he split the sea

Niggas don't want smoke, trust me, it's all talk
Mention one of my niggas again and you'll taste salt
Blood in your mouth, nigga, dick in your spouse, nigga
Just give me a reason to bring them things back out, nigga
It ain't 'bout the check, pussy nigga, don't check for me
For disrespect, send a bullet respectfully
I put my niggas on, you know that we next to be
Runnin' this rap shit, it's W-H and G

I wish a nigga would say hood in the presence of a nigga that
Just don't give a fuck, you better level up (Flash homie)
Put your bezel up, ain't nothin change, it's forever (Ante Up)
I come with the medal up
Right in V.I.P. is where we'll settle up
I need everything including the Möet and the cup
Brooklyn, New York (Legend), pledging allegiance
Clowns that get out of bounds and don't follow procedures

Ayo, you fucking with the overbite boss
I pull up on on your block wavin' a torch, leave a corpse on your porch
It's killas in the room
I smell Erykah Badu's incense when y'all niggas in the room ('Cause y'all pussy)
I will squeeze and clap (C'mon), but I'll never discuss cheese with rats (Nigga)
I'm the pallbearer that'll throw you in the ground
With that blacka blacka b-blacka b-blacka black BLAW!

Some in there be the commission, we ain't askin' for permission to hit 'em
Why his children be with 'em? Bag drops, slide up and twist 'em
Thirsty for clout on your laptop, that's how you get finished
Homie was cappin', knocked him out of his fitted
Pick up the product and zip it (Zip)
You dyin' to be famous, I couldn't imagine it
Applying only torture, these niggas softer than fab-er-ic
Far from av-er-age
3-5-7 on me, knockin’ Cam “Horse & Carriage" shit
If I was you, that'd be embarrassin'

Told Slay if this rap don't pop
Fuck selling drops, I be back up on that old shit
Masks and gloves on like I'm tryna dodge COVID
I'm making coats fresh like aerobics over the stove with
The burner on like I'm Emeril Lagasse
Streets sweep you off your feet like Drake on Degrassi
You gon' need a colostomy bag if you tryna stop mine
Came with drums on it bigger than Loretta Devine
With a shot better than Steph and LeBron
I'm on my grind, bitch

Pass the baton, I'm rap crack packed in a bong
One immaculate blast and you gone
My craft is beyond mastered, it's blasphemy having me on a song
For less than 3 16's like a chapter from John
Rappers get laid off when I'm working
Man, I ain't even have to concentrate to get this 8 off like a German
That's light work, I can rap last or rhyme first
Pick ya poison, I'm poised, they picking my verse

See the dirtiest of the dirtiest, the godfather
Still'll jack you with no gun, choke you with your car charger
Slay hit me up on the gram and said, "Damn
You don't even need a buzz to be gettin' love from your fans"
I said there's a difference between a fan and a follower
These niggas went from dick-lickin' to being straight swallowers
Follow or see the trend in 'em follow, that's a no hand
Niggas wanna be like Chicago, scared to death to go there (YEAH, yeah)

Uh, throw the V's up for victory
Goat when they mention me, dope era history
Gettin' violated, annihilated, I only do Sanaa Lathan
Fire satin', God body, I got the choir hatin'
Rich and rude, plus my lifestyle is ravishing
Laying wood on your wife, I swear it's a cabinet
Oakland inhabitant, lifestyle extravagant
Me going broke? Yeah, right, couldn't imagine it

Fuck the system, it's a premise, these visions mentally different
Never be victims, equity grippin', melodies is meant to be different
Remember the rhythm, marches when we melanin pigment
Embedded and gifted, we said it and did it
Raise a power fist, 24/7 just look where I was at
They fueled by cowardice and called us powerless, and proud of it
Sucka shit, we gon' keep the hover like a mother ship
 raisin' kings and queens just like our mothers did

Allow me to do what I do best, then why you rest on my chest, there's a huge S
Niggas that's talkin' that real shit, only a few left but not a huge threat
Send shots that afflict, nigga, what they send back, you gon' need two vests
So, please stay off my dick 'less you got a fat ass and two huge breasts
I been to hell and back and I fuck the devil in a blue dress
Give me the motor, then know I'ma show up and feel in me, make him like you less
In this industry, all I see is pussies and dickheads like group sex
They waitin' for what I'ma do next and I'm lookin' around like who's next, Compton

Hit 'em in the body like a millimeter
?with about a minute? for the rhythm a lobotomy
?if anybody? pull it when they wanna get up in the middle
Of the way I do and never givin' an apology
Ought to be up in the talk, I'm one of the better
Veterans who murderin' and get up on the beat and be the
One up in the middle of the battle and I'm ready for the
War, I be the one and when I do it they retreat
With the feelin' of a breeze of a Great Lake
Automatic and it's cinematic when I'm in the
Attic and they get erratic on the bass, put 'em in a
Little bit of panic and I make 'em wanna vacate
Kay Slay just made a way
To make and I stay safe when I lay 8
It's like I ?lay tape?
Like I'm Biggie the late great
Twista

Fuck all the lyrical shit, bitch, I'm a game spitter
And I tried to told you that I got bars (Like what?) just like a phone charge
Comin' up out of the slum, the gut of the beast (The gut of the beast)
I don't need no iron, I'm already creased (Already creased)
Immune to violence (Violence), ambulance and police (Police)
Gotta keep your silence (Silence), out here in the streets (Streets)
Rappers don't rap like me, I don't rap like them (Rap like them)
I pull your card just like a sim (Bitch)

You know where I be, drinkin' in the lobby
Smokin' on gelati, slidin' off with a thottie (Huh?)
Stomach on a gate, made a quick stop to Haji's (Yo)
Walk in any club in New York with no ID
Shorty think 'cause her ass fat, she could line me
I'm like a dead end, you can't get nothing by me (Stop it)
I'm Nino Man, I keep shooters behind me
They knew how I was comin' already when Kiss signed me

Y'all Johny come lately, I was on time
On the road like white lines, readin' all signs
Cleanin' off knives after tallyin' what was taken
Your man got pinched, my man with him, he said he breakin'
Said he came out the gate strong, but now he waverin'
Said the G's fadin' him 'cause he wouldn't put paint in
My name strongest spot you could put a leg in
Fact rap shootin', you know that I stay wavin'

Welcome to the revolution, this is gon' be televised
Coward dies a thousand deaths, real nigga never dies
I had to memorize the rules of the game
I learned from the fools and got jewels from the lames
Refuse to entertain you sucker niggas on IG
I'm outside every day, nigga find me
See, you can try me, just don't  me
Realest nigga alive is how you define me

Blatant with my right hand, sneaky my left hook
All my peers know my gear stuck on Westbrook
You claim to be the greatest all over the sport
But all I see is a nigga is shakin' while holdin' the torch
Proceed, go ahead, try to take the lead
And then tell us how it feels not to succeed
Up to par and up to speed
You already know my body, how many more bars do you niggas need?

Get shot in broad day fuckin' 'round in L.A
Home of the gang bang where we let our nuts hang
Peel your motherfuckin' cap, I put the city on the map
Crackhouse in '92 is what new niggas call a trap
I'ma keep it gangsta 'til they put me in the fuckin' dirt
Cali keeps it grimey, cuz,  get work
'Berg nigga, hair trigger, West Coast, elmos
Khakis, chucks, lowrides, white tee's, and homicides

This lightning, son of a tee, travellin' Hebrew
Kryptonian, only trip on niggas I see through
Born sinner, habitually illuminative behavior
I don't fuck with your savior, if he ain't lookin' like we do
Nigga vegan, but I still enjoy beefin' with pigs
Not a Corleone, Luca Brasi could sleep with the fish
Send 'em somethin' sleezy so I could teach 'em
That I could reach 'em and how we do that hog meat real greezy

Uh, Slay told me to get the weaponry
So I wrote the verse before he got finished textin' me
A spliff, and in about 60 seconds, I've written destiny
I'm glowin', nigga, look, my  been sittin' next to me
Yeah, rapper remarkably, savage authority
Clappin' and Smiffen, Daryl Dixon, look like I'm practicin' archery
The walking dead, tell every rapper that spar with me
Cooler than Billy Dee with the cigar and mahogany

Fuck your favorite rapper, bitch, I'm not a actor
It's games and laughter towards pains and pastors
That Aftermath for the matter, with four, five, I make 'em scatter
It's like at now and later, you referred the latter
What's understood is overstood
You could be a bitch and a snitch and still rep the hood
Your bars are no good, we don't trust you
Not you, not one beef, you govern me

Speak up, you don't understand still
Then heat up, bet you understand steel
Get you beat up or put you on a standstill
It's rush hour and the traffic's at a standstill
Slay know I'm mad I missed his album
But I don't play, like math, the kid's a problem
Different kind of caliber of problem
And my whips look like  problem

Loaded Lux, I got a page for each chapter
Slay you on your job, uncie raisin' up the bar, what?
It's beats and rappers, we gon' have to build
Niggas got talents, but they soundin' off balance
Man, you ain't even kill
Youngin in the sports, it's not a loss
But all that Tommy got Hilfiger, he wasn't cut from this cloth
But who's the judge the way they threw him the book?
It seem kinda fishy the way you got off the hook

I'm jaded, drunk in the whip playing Jadakiss
Nah, I ain't worried 'bout Will and Jada bis
You should get with me, Mayweather with victories
Ice Tiffany like crystally, tight symmetry
Flights to Italy and Congo, hit 'em with the calm flow
Mamis follow everywhere the Don goes
Plush condos, ice in the wing like Rondo's
Million dollar convos, we on the those

A lotta clowns in the game, they mama should've aborted 'em
Snitch and come home, y'all people still supportin' them
I'm Makaveli trained, testament of his tutelage
Really had to be outside, you couldn't Google it
If Noble Outlaw, known to spit the truest shit
Over twenty years in this game, still doin' it
Thugger peace, Kadafi, Fatal Hussein
Shoutouts to Kay Slay and E.D.I Mean

We on a mission, thiefs in the tab, but we get 'em
Them all playin' the victim, we gon' spray 'em and split 'em
Kay Slay say "hit 'em", so we did 'em, it's done
Black and brown in this bitch and we all for one
Better be cautious, son, 'cause the time is now
Look, no more talk, where the riders now?
We ain't even tryna hide it, we ain't hard to find
And I ain't got shit for a bitch but a hard time

Yeah, picture me sacrificin' integrity
Yeah, picture me gaslightin' the gaslighters, I prophetically
Foreshadow the shallow, ended the pool you spoke from
If you believe in idols, what happens when you invoke one?
Utter insanity
The first rapper to take me out of context can expect a fuckin' calamity
This is much deeper than music or surface vanity
A soundtrack to bounce back, you understandin' me?

The hustler, I supply smokers
But eventually, I'm tryin' to get a B like my guy Hova
I got this chick 'bout to drive over
She bisexual, but take the whole pole 'cause she bipolar
Look, she got some amazing puss
So I'm shootin' my shot, but not what Tory did to Megan foot
They shootin', brrat, I made you look
So they can see how afraid you look, facts

They gon' miss me when I'm all gone
Tell 'em bury me with legends and the drug lords
Next to ST put me with 
At my wake, all my bitches in a different row
Gotta stop rappin' 'bout dyin', let me switch it up
Keys to the Lamb' truck, they gon' see me act up
Lover a bitch who got lip fillers and an ass done
Cap, what? Nigga, who? We about that action

Cedar or don, milk crate, G's in the pond
Hold the dice, NYPD alarm
Need to be calm, nothin' but gunshots, kids need to be home
Block so hot the fire hydrant need to be on
The fiends buy it, have it for days wired
Servin' out the Hyatt, wanted to be Dave Hyatt
Countin' at the table, the weed and the cigs fired
I'm out of town, trunk full of ki's and the plate expirin'

Had me checkin' your chest, no backgammon, the MAC blammin'
This rag hammer, get too fly, you get crashlanded
I slap fam for wackness, slackin' their trash, fam
Train y'all bitches, no smashin' in the mass transit
B-b-oss, look at the scars on this hymn
B-b-ars, I'm the concrete jungle gym
Shinin' through this wildlife, Jungle Jim
Named my Glock 19-COVID, got y'all up on punishment

Certain suckas used to be homies, now you put 'em in chalk
When they see you try to walk the other direction and play it off
I be clean up in that rental with that flame comin' cleaner than 
Them suckas know I kill  I'ma spray
Buck buck, blow blow
Thought I was a lame, I brought the pain, what ya think now?
Now that I'm the game, what you should've did was bow
Papoose, let loose, put them bitches in the ground

Ay, no arguments, yo, you know I spit the hardest
As far as this rap thing, taught continents
Been a monster since I stepped on the scene
'fore this rap game in the zone slingin' to fiends
Chrome thing in my jeans, diamonds dancin'
Flawless, lookin' clean, Porsche lookin' mean
I'm lawless, I like to floss in Europeans
Gruff stay on his deen, stay chasin' the green

This that heat rock, the way the beat knock
Came a long way from movin' sheet rock
Not a CL Smooth and I feel like Pete Rock
The way I be paranoid, I keep that heat cocked
When you the plug, you don't even get to eat
Phone clickin' every minute, I rarely miss a beat
My weed plug is Asian, I keep the thugs blazin'
Before I left the waves spin, I rock braids then

I don't give a fuck about niggas that ain't on my side
I don't care who they kill, long as none of my niggas die
Violate the gang, somebody catchin' that head shot
We ain't rattin', we gon' beat whatever cases the feds got
Fuck mainstream, in the streets I'm relevant
This for my niggas that been locked up since Bush was the president
You gon' die broke and kids growin' up poor ,nigga
Your baby mom is regrettin' fuckin' you raw, nigga

Bring your crew, they could visit the fish
Cause them niggas'll get wet for shorts like a midget just pissed
You shoot like you got permission to miss
You wouldn't clap nickels by a fountain with yo' bitch in a wish
I don't ball room brawl, fuck a kick and a fist
When I wrestle the bull dog, threw my wrist in a twist
When we was kids they let us pick the shit up for kicks
But my nigga just caught a trip, for a stick and a brick
Nigga

I couldn't quarantine , fall back
I'm so alive, I got a mask on my ballsack (Rrah)
Even my microphone coughin', fiend, snitch
The vicious while kissin' more bad bitches than Richard Dawson (Rah)
Family feud, calamity due, your dogs
I stand with any man, hand 'em a can of dog food (Rrah)
So call me black Santa Claus, I put mistletoe on my drawers
All fake rappers can suck me off

Yo soy capitán, yo no soy marinero
Meaning if we was a 10, I'd be the 1, you'd be the 0
And no, I'm not the GOAT, motherfucker, I'm the hero
Shapiro, dinero, I'm the Alpha, you're the Romeo
I blaze trails like I'm Melo in Portland
I ain't rich out this bitch, I'm no Palmer Cortlandt
No mansion, no yachts, and no fleet of cars
But I'm a beast on this mic, you couldn't find sweeter bars

King Truth play in the city, I'm the recruiter
Game time, steppin' away and you meet the shooter
Real streets send 'em a message, no computer
Hit the block, I leave niggas missin' like it's Bermuda
Air where them niggas was fightin' and pitchin' crack
Any day I could send you a coroner, get you packed
Never worry about the who nigga talkin', he in a act
Asshole, get your whole house flipped when I react

If the sun don't shine forever
I got 30 in this bitch with the beam, I'll .9 whoever
Get your mask shot off your face, nigga
Social distancin', but I still will spank niggas
Ayo, Slay, they ain't like that, the chopper causin' massacres
Shake the whip, had these niggas crawlin' over passengers
That citizen app, get to goin' off
Latex gloves for the drill, niggas butter soft

45th, I'm a shooter, niggas know I shoot shit
Pull up, we gon' make it hot, we ain't on that cool shit
Greezy, nuisance, easy, ruthless
Hit 'em 'cause I'm wowed, then I'm out, deuces
Come to 9G, I keep a pair, that's petty pack
I don't rock designers, but I'll line ya, that's a Fendi fact
I'm from where if niggas see your chain they be like, "give me that"
But if you say my name you might get it back, Mob Ties

Reaches on, FEMA bones, speakers on, need a loan
 flown,  home features on, king of throne
Trippie Redd exterior, seat is on
Hematome, rims gleamin' chrome
Whip leanin' on, adrenochrome
Peons tryna reach me, I'm science
My seeds travel for eons through Keedron Bryant
Me and 'Preem and Obama just sippin' Pino in yarmulkes
Lickin' cream off of models with Miss Marina and Abramovich
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and goofy guys
See niggas die over rap, woes, and pussy pride
'Cause Snoopy cried or 'cause Pookie lied
Y'all watch the mag blow and I'll watch both of your eyes do the tootsie slide
