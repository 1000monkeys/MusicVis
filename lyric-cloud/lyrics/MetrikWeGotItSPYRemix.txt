It's been a long time waiting
Been a long time waiting on you, on you
I've got a lot of love riding
I've got a lot of love riding on you, on you

You tell me I can do what I wanna do
You tell me I can be who I wanna be
You lead me here, don't let me down

I leave you my heart, so take it
Showed you my hand, your time to play it
I don't want time to change it
I wanna know what's going on
Are you gonna tell me?
(Are you gonna?)
Are you gonna?
(Are you gonna?)

You're the one that I believe in
So don't give me no reason to die, oh no
You're the one that I invest in
Every minute of every hour

You tell me I'll be safe standing next to you
You tell me you need me like I need you
You lead me here, don't let me down

I leave you my heart, so take it
Showed you my hand, your time to play it
I don't want time to change it
I wanna know what's going on
Are you gonna tell me?
(Are you gonna?)
Are you gonna?
(Are you gonna?)

Are you gonna tell me what I do to you?
Can I sit back? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
Tell me what I do to you
Can I sit back? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
(Are you gonna tell me?)
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
Are you gonna tell me?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
