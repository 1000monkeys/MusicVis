Beat me up
Beat me down
Mess me up
Beyond all recognition
For what it's worth
I'd do it again
With no consequence
I will do it again
Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun bust a cap hit the ground
Yo yo yo, word
My tendency's never returned
Received like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
Cause you know that's what I heard
Tell ya thoughts that's most impure
So everything's splendid, sure
I just there to injure
On the fence
The consequence
What do they know
About that
On the track
Ahead in the back
What do they know
About that
I'm quite depressed
I'm quite a mess
Beat me up
Beat me down
Mess me up
Beyond all recognition
For what it's worth
I'd do it again
With no consequence
I will do it again
Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun bust a cap hit the ground
Yo yo yo, word
My tendency's never returned
Received like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
Cause you know that's what I heard
Tell ya thoughts that's most impure
So everything's splendid, sure
I just there to injure
On the fence
The consequence
What do they know
About that
On the track
Ahead of the pack
What do they know
About that
I'm quite depressed
I'm quite a mess
Hey, I'm someone to stab in the back
Hey, I'm someone to fall through the crack
Hey, I'm someone to punch in the face
Hey, I'm someone to fall through the crack
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Written all over my face
Jump the gun bust a cap hit the ground
Yo yo yo, word
My tendency's never returned
Received like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
Cause you know that's what I heard
Tell ya thoughts that's most impure
So everything's splendid, sure
I just there to in-jure
On the fence
The consequence
What do they know
About that
On the track
Ahead in the back
What do they know
About that
I'm quite depressed
I'm quite a mess
