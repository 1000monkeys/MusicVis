Take away the pain
Tear me down in flames
Touch me like you do
Fall right back to you
Only to the cloud
With me when I'm foul
Touch me like you do
Fall right back to you

Don't tell me this doesn't feel right
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout it every night
Don't tell me this doesn't feel right
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout it every night

Take away the pain
Pull it from my vein
Touch me like you do
Fall right back to you
Pull me underneath
Hold me 'till I breathe
Touch me like you do
Fall right back to you

Don't tell me this doesn't feel right (Feel right, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout it every night (Oh no)
Don't tell me this doesn't feel right (Feel right, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout it every night
