You know what I want
You know what I need
Put your boots on, honey
And take a walk with me
You know what I want
You know what I need
Put your boots on, honey
And take it- take it- just take it to the beat

Just take it to the beat
Just take it to the beat
Woah-ah-ah-ah-oh
Just take it the the beat
Woah-ah-ah-ah-oh

Just take it to the beat
Just take it to the beat
If you may fall
If you may bleed
I'll pick you back up, honey
I'll put you on my sleeve
If you may fall
If you may bleed
I'll pick you back up, honey
Just take it- just take it- just take it to the beat

Woah-ah-ah-ah-oh
Just take it to the beat
Woah-ah-ah-ah-oh

Just take it to the beat
(take it, take it to the beat)
Just take it to the beat
(take it, take it to the beat)
Just take it to the beat
Just take it to the beat
Just take it to the beat
Take it to the beat
(Just take it to the beat)
Ooh-oh-oh
