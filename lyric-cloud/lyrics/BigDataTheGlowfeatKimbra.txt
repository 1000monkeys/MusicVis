Dark child, hiding in the white light
Ain't nobody gotta know
Late nights, hiding in the bright lights
Undercover in the glow

Come and roll with the masses
It's a new rite of passage
We know your addresses, boy
Come and fall with the masses
We're burning and crashing
It's all for the message, boy
Oh yeah

Making light of it
When you're winning
(But they're out to get ya)
They'll go way out for another hit
Only time will let you go
But I won't forget

Dark child, step into the white light
Ain't nobody gotta know
Everybody's in the glow
Child, I'm gonna keep you safe (gonna keep you safe)
Ain't nobody gotta know
Everybody's in the glow

Come and roll with the masses
We know what your past is
We know what you're asking, boy
Going down with the masses
We're burning and crashing
Right down to the ashes, boy

Making light of it
When you're winning
(But they're out to get ya)
They'll go way out for another hit
(But they're out to get ya)
Only time will let you go
But I won't forget

Dark child, step into the white light
Ain't nobody gotta know
Everybody's in the glow
Child, I'm gonna keep you safe (gonna keep you safe)
Ain't nobody gotta know
Everybody's in the glow

(Everybody's in the glow)
Dark child
Dark child
Dark child

Dark child
Ain't nobody gotta know
Everybody's in the glow
Dark child
Undercover in the glow
Everybody's in the glow
Dark child
Ain't nobody gotta know
Everybody's in the glow
Child, I'm gonna keep you safe
Dark child
Everybody's in the glow
