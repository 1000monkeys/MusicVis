Oh you come, sick from something
How you fight to keep it under
Tell me something,  why you're running
Why you feel the need to shelter from the cold
To lie awake with the thoughts surrounding
Count, cold, the way you was before

Cold just seems to disappear inside you
To lift you up, I'm always here beside you, beside you
Tell me what you need, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you feel, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you need, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you feel, I'm here to comfort you
To comfort you

See it, receded, feel it, floating
Break through the ceiling, find it beneath you
Free from the cold, I wonder why you're a distant memory
You come, come back to life

Cold just seems to disappear inside you
To lift you up, I'm always here beside you, beside you
Tell me what you need, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you feel, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you need, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you feel, I'm here to comfort you
To comfort you

You're far away, you're fading out of sight
You're closer now, I see you're coming back to life
Tell me what you need, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you feel, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you need, I'm here to comfort you
Tell me what you feel, I'm here to comfort you
To comfort you
