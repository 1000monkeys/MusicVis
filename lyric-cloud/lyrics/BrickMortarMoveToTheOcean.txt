Do you think about the life you live?
Seeing as you have to
Think about the things you did
Things that they don't do
Together we could make a stand
You could take some too
'Cause I could use a helping hand
We'll move to the ocean
To feed off the daylight
Was hoping that you'd understand
I got a darkness, darkness
But you don't gotta hold my hand
Do you got a darkness, darkness?
Together we could take a stand
First 10 years didn't feel so hard
7 after that seemed to push me too far
Jump to 19 I'm livin' outta my car
Wrote my first song and took back my heart
Sick and tired of feeling like I'm such a loser
Sick and tired of feelin' it always, always
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
We'll move to the ocean
To feed off the daylight
Was hoping that you'd understand
I got a darkness, darkness
But you don't gotta hold my hand
Do you got a darkness, darkness?
Together we could take a stand
Steal what you can and keep what you got
Give it to the world and don't ever stop
Work all day with your feet on the floor
Harder, harder, harder for a little bit more
It's possible
Do you think about the life you live?
Seeing as you have to
Think about the things you did
Things that they won't do
I think I'm gonna make a stand
You should make one too
Together we could make a stand
Together we could take a stand
