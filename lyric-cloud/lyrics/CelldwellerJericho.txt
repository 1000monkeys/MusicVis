You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

You build 'em up
You layer stone on stone
You build 'em high
To keep out your enemies
The sky grows dark
The earth is trembling
An unhappy ending
To your final fantasy

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

We'll all enjoy the show
When your walls fall like Jericho

You're looking down
And feeling so profound
You're so impressed
By your own false humility
The sky descends
The ground is rising up
An unhappy ending
To your sense of deity

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)

You sit alone
Up on your lonely throne
You're so oblivious
To your own frailty
The sky erupts
The ground has opened wide
An unhappy ending
To the life you've glorified
To the life you've glorified

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
We'll all enjoy the show
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)
When your walls fall like Jericho
(This is over, this is over)
We'll all enjoy the show
It's do-do-down you go
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)
(This is over, this is over)
