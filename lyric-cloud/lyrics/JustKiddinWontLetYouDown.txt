As a morning pulls you under
You can trust me 'cause I am your friend
When you like you are falling
Let me hold you

Don't let it go 'cause I won't let you down
Been here before and I won't let you down
Need you to believe I'll always be around
Want you know, tell me you know
I won't let you down, down
Tell me you know, let you know
I won't let you down, down
Tell me you know, let you know
Don't let it go 'cause I won't let you down
Tell me you know, let you know
I won't let you down, down
Tell me you know
Don't let it go 'cause I won't let you down
Been here before and I won't let you down
Need you to believe I'll always be around
Want you know, tell me you know
I won't let you down, down
Down, down
Tell me you know, let you know
I won't let you down, down
Tell me you know, let you know
I won't let you down

As the sun dies and the light fades
We are shining right here 'til the end
You are stronger than you know
You have got me

Don't let it go 'cause I won't let you down
Been here before and I won't let you down
Need you to believe I'll always be around
Want you know, tell me you know
I won't let you down, down
Tell me you know, let you know
I won't let you down, down
Tell me you know, let you know
Don't let it go 'cause I won't let you down
Been here before and I won't let you down
Need you to believe I'll always be around
Want you know, tell me you know
I won't let you down
