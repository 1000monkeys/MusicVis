Stuck in the same room, in the same mood
Everybody tried to tell me what I can't do
Everybody tried to tell me that I changed too
And I changed lanes from you lame dudes
It's been a minute since I spilled my pain
Had to take a step back and look at life in a different way
If you want the change, you gotta be the change
Now we're all the same
Nobody wanna take the reins
Nobody wanna push their brain
Nobody will admit that they're fake for the facts they claim
You see we're all imperfect in a perfect way
And while we work all day, we all work, no play
We are slaved to the loans and the bills we pay
You consume a double cheese when the radio play
Mainstream, Mickey D's and my shit gourmet
I've been up for seven days straight
Tryin' to figure out my fate
Tryin' to figure out any way to put food on my plate
But I sold a few tee's, so I'm eating today
Okay, doing okay
Could probably do better, came home to a letter
Eviction, I know I don't fit your description of rapper
But me I'm a clearer, they threw all the chatter
I know everything that glitter ain't gold
Life is the clay, you too busy to mold
Time here is taking its toll
We spend all our time without passion and then we get old
Was told I should go quit
But none of you see all the letters I get from these kids
Who hurt from within and don't wanna live
And tell me my music is all that can give them hope
Yeah, all we need is some hope
And they tell me their family's broken and broke
They usin' my music to cope
I've been on that boat, held down by a rope
Held down by a string, y'all looking for things
I'm looking to change the perception of people
And all of the beautiful things that it brings, yeah
Record in my closet, don't make enough profit
Y'all used to have morals and somehow you lost it
Don't care about the money I spend on my coffin
I care bout the people attendin'
And often we're lost, lost in this world
We're selfish to think, "I could find happiness in a girl"
We're selfish to think we're elite, we destroy and deplete
Our whole planet no smarter than squirrels
So who wants to talk about that?
Who wants to talk about facts
Maybe I'd be in your mag
If I added "Tunechi" or "bap bap"
Or I talked about weed when I rap
But fuck all of that, the voice of the youth
The voice of the people, the real and the truth
The voice of the one who had nothin' to lose
I speak for a heart that's been broken and beaten and bruised
I'm tired of holes in my shoes
Tired of having to move
Tired of coming unglued
Tired of cleanin' your table and servin' you food
We are what we choose
If only you knew the shit that I've seen
I can't tell if I'm lucid or livin' the dream
I don't do it for me, do it all for the team
I remember back livin' when I was a teen
And my grandma, she said I was worthless
And my teachers said I had no purpose
And my mama she said I was perfect
I'm sittin' on Twitter while I should be workin' on verses
You're worth it, and when you feel weak
The deeper the trench, the higher the peak
See y'all are a piece of my legacy 'cause you believe
We can be anything and I wanna beâ€¦ me
