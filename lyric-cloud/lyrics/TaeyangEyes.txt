You left me paralyzed
No cure, no rehab for me
Funny that you got the nerve to keep askin' me
How I've been
You're the victor in this pageantry
But the only trophy you deserve: catastrophe
I'd rather we be dead to each other
No eulogies said for each other
No rest in peace's
The memories, got my chest in pieces
I'm prayin' that your eyes are the first to go
The way they looked when you smiled
The way they opened and closed
Then your nose, every single breath against my neck
And then your lips, every empty promise made and said

Please fade, fade, fade, fade to black
Please fade, fade, fade, fade to black
But the nightmares come back

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath, every kiss
Still got me dyin'
Still got me cryin'
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath, every kiss
Still got me dyin'
Still got me cryin'

Forget a promenade
Let's juggernaut down memory lane
Leave no thought alive to the slaughterhouse
I'm takin' my pain
It's time to sever my brain from my heart and soul
My knees are burnin' hot but God is cold
I've been told "One day, you'll know too much of heaven's a sin
After the show, it's only hell that it brings
So take it slow and let time heal everything"
They say that time flies but you keep breakin' its wings

You'll never fade, fade, fade, fade to black
Please fade, fade, fade, fade to black
But the nightmares come back

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath, every kiss
Still got me dyin'
Still got me cryin'
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath, every kiss
Still got me dyin'
Still got me cryin'
[Bridge: Tablo & 
TAEYANG

You wish me well (You wish me well)
You wish me well (You wish me well)
I wish you hell
I never wanna look into your eyes again
No, I never wanna hear you breathe again
Let me go, let me go
Baby, tell me this is the end

Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath, every kiss
Still got me dyin'
Still got me cryin'
The tears drive me out of my mind
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath, every kiss
Still got me dyin'
Still got me cryin'
Cryin', cryin'

Fade out
