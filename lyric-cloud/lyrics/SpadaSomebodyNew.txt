Maybe you took it and things would ends up this way with you
Never thought I'd see the day I wake up without you here

In case you feel the same way as I do
I climb from my room tonight
Yeah I know I should never really assume
What's going through your mind

'Cause it is you and I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it, no I don't wanna talk about it
You know that it's you
Maybe you just need somebody
You need somebody
Maybe you just need somebody


What if I  don't ever see your face here again, no
I don't need another lover if it ain't you, right here

In case you feel the same way as I do
I climb from my room tonight
Yeah I know I should never really assume
What's going through your mind

'Cause it is you and I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it, no I don't wanna talk about it
You know that it's you
Maybe you just need somebody
You need somebody
Maybe you just need somebody


'Cause it is you and I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it, no I don't wanna talk about it
You know that it's you
Maybe you just need somebody
You need somebody
Maybe you just need somebody
