You say mysterious
Well, I say I'm just a lonely wolf wandering
A bit delirious
When all the trees appear the same, appear the same

Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold

The voices in my head
They echo in the wind and I begin to sway
I follow what they say
I can't see their eyes, but I hear howling through the haze

Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
Gold, gold

Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Cast me away, my shadow's cold
Into the barrens where I will grow old
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
Well, I'm not looking for answers
And I'm not looking for gold
