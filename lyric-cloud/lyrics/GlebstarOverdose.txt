DJ Kay Slay A.K.A. Snap Your Favourite DJ
In the building with my niggas
Street Entertainment

Ayo—finger-fuckin' Donna Karan
Dick-sucks from Donatella—we the most glamour
Arm & Hammer manners
Hermes handkerchief wiping off brain-matter
Cocaine Fister
Cruise through the city with a pity prap
Fendi jumpers, Hublot band, crocodiles
True duffel filled with white—where the fuck Frank at?
Tony shot Pussy, cop a couple stoves ASAP
Most luxurious, check the resume
Devastatin' wind
Versace got his brains blew out
I dropped a tear
Sold dope all year
Took a stack out the Lanvin box and copped me another pair
Bagging blow in that Rick Owens
Shoot our mamie house if you niggas owe us
Ten chains on all rose golding
Back to back lamb trucks my niggas rolling
This Illmatic meets Purple Tape
Gemstar on the mkqassa plate
Elephant drums flip you from a block away
Balenciagia kicks, jumpin over fence, baking soda mix
So much fishscale my broke scale
Snakeskin on the gazelles
You not parallel
Shells of rain
Burberry brick
Waterproof from the pain
Slain...

Souping up dope
Louis Belt wrapped around my arm, analyzing the rush
I hope I don't overdose
We been marking Dope Man's Paradise
Blood colored benzos speeding through Hell
Prada the Devil, Hitler wears Hermes
Sadam in that Fendi
God's Bugatti truck is filled, where'd he steal that from?
Life of luxury, that's what life's all about
Glamour, Loyalty, Respect, Air Hole TECs
Was a soundtrack, need I say more?
Sky was golden, money made up the floor
Dice games raw, poverty stricken, residue stained dishes
Clean that off, you gotta eat
Time waits never, green presidential
Presidential Rollies, take one sniff of Sax 5th
Just fly for eternity, pray the queen don't murder me
