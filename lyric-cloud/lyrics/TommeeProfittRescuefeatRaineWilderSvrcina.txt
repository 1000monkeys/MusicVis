If your building is burning
I'll be the fire escape
If your rooms full of smoke
And youre starting to choke
Im the mask on your face
If your windows are locked
I'll be the brick thatll break it away
You're all that I got
To save your life
I would race to my grave
When the weight on your shoulders
Grows from a rock to a boulder
I am one man but I'll stand like an army of soldiers
I'll be the gun in your holster
I'll be the shield
That blocks every sword
I'll be the steal
The fires will forge
To bring you peace
I'll will go in to war
Ain't afraid of the rain
I trained in a storm
I'll run to your rescue
When it all comes down
When it starts to fall
Like an avalanche
I will be your wall
I will hold you up
Go against them all
When it all comes down
I'll be standing tall
I'll run to your rescue
If you're feeling surrounded
And the sound of your heart
Pounds in your head
If your hands start to shake
And there's sweat on your face
And you're tasting adrenaline
When the world that's around you
Comes crashing down on you
And the grounds sinking in
I'll be the spark
The light in the dark
Fast as a flash
I'll come runnin in
If you're in danger
And your ship drifts
I'm your anchor
I told you I'd save ya
There's no need to be afraid
Sworn I was born for this
Fighting wave after wave
And the storm keeps on coming
I don't fear when I hear the war drumming
It gets near
And my pulse, it starts pumping
It's My heart ain't bleeding for nothing
I'll set you free
When you're locked in a cell
Ill find you heaven
When you're lost in hell
I'm your Guardian angel
A part of you's tangled
Got stripes from the war
That you wear like a bangle
Walk thru the jungle
Don't worry about trouble
I got the force
Surround me in the bubble
I'll jump in the rumble
Im ready to kill em
When everyone wears a mask
Who's the real villain
