Where you go I'll follow
I'll follow you, I'll never stray
So lead the way, lead the way
Lead the way-ay-ay

Escape with you in a moment
Close my eyes anywhere but here
Far away, far away I'm far away-ay-ay

You got something about you
I can't wait to try you on

I-I-I wanna see through you
I-I-I wanna feel it too
You-ou-ou are real to me, my reality
Wanna see through you

They pull me back out of concern
But every night I return
I know the way, know the way
I know the way-ay-ay

If they don't believe
They'll never see
Never see what you do to me
So run away, run away
I'll run away-ay-ay

Because there's something about you
I can't wait to try you on

I-I-I wanna see through you
I-I-I wanna feel it too
You-ou-ou are real to me, my reality
Wanna see through you

Ooh oh oh oh
Wanna see through you
Ooh oh oh oh

There's just something about you
I can't wait to try you on
Try you on, try you on
Because there's something about you
Try you on, try you on
You've got something about you

I-I-I wanna see through you
I-I-I wanna feel it too
You-ou-ou are real to me, my reality
Wanna see through you

I-I-I wanna see through you
I-I-I, I wanna see through you
