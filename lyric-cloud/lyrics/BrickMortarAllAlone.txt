Words can fall straight from the sky
I trusted you more than, I trusted you than
My old life, oh yes, that's right
Words in a book in a statement you made
When you thought it would last your whole life
(Fear driving alone)
Fear of the world and the things that it does
And you ask where it always goes wrong

Fear driving all alone
I took the wrong road home
(I don't know, I don't know)
Just which way to go?
I let the melody show
(I don't know, I don't know)
We're dying all alone
(Dying all alone)

What, you gonna run your whole life?
Feet on the ground with your head in the clouds
That ain't no life, oh yes, that's right
Words can fall straight from the sky
Names in a book of the people you'll be
And the things that you'll do with your life
Fear of the world and the things that it does
And you ask where it always goes wrong

Fear driving all alone
I took the wrong road home
(I don't know, I don't know)
Just which way to go?
I let the melody show
(I don't know, I don't know)
Fear dying all alone
(Fear dying all alone)

Words in a book, in a statement you made
When you thought it would last your whole life
Fear of the world and the things that it does
And you ask where it always goes wrong

Fear driving all alone
I took the wrong road home
(I don't know, I don't know)
Just which way to go?
I let the melody show
(I don't know, I don't know)
Fear driving all alone
I took the wrong road home
(I don't know, I don't know)
Just which way to go?
I let the melody show
(I don't know, I don't know)
Fear dying all alone
(Fear dying all alone)
