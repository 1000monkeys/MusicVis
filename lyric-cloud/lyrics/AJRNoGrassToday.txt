Oh, I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great

Does the grass look greener (greener)
On my side of the speakers (speakers)
I tried a couple weekends
But that green’s not for me
I thought I’d get clever
Make my lyrics come out better
But at 7/11’s where you would find me

Don’t wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You want a hit, it’s your choice
But please enjoy the show

I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great

Last night at the concert (concert)
The audience, it flickers (flickers)
They’re lighting up like Christmas
Still, that green’s not for me
On corners people cursing
To legalize their burning
But that ain’t no concern of mine
I keep doing me

Don’t wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You want a hit, it’s your choice
But please enjoy the show

I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
[Bridge: Ryan Met & 
Jack Met
]
I’m not narcissistic
I’m just high off the music
And I don’t wanna miss it
But I wouldn’t stop you
I’m not narcissistic
You light up if you like it
And though I may not like it
You just keep doing you
(You just keep doing you)

Keep- keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing keep doing me
Keep- keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me

I didn't smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
