The thought of it is killing me
The words you said will never ever leave me
And the dream of it's the only thing left for me
But that's just fine 'cause that's all I really need

Do you dream if you're falling out of love?
Do you dream of what you are giving up?
Do you dream if you're falling out of love?
Do you dream of what you are giving up?
Do you dream if you're falling out of love?
Do you dream of what you are giving up?

I close my eyes, I see your face
And I know, I know, I know that you're coming back to me
I hear your voice I call your name
But no one, no one, no one is calling back to me
It's a perfect world with you in it
And I finally felt I was living it
And I tell myself that it isn't real
As you walk away and I don't feel
The love, the love, the love, it won't come back to me
The love, the love, the love, it won't come back to me

The thought of it is killing me, is killing me
The words you said will never ever leave me
The dream of it is the only thing left for me
But that's just fine 'cause that's all I really need

Do you dream if you're falling out of love?
Do you dream of what you are giving up?
Do you, do you dream?
Do you dream if you're falling out of love?
Do you dream of what you are giving up?
Do you, do you dream?
Do you dream of love?
Do you dream, do you dream of love?

Do you dream? Do you?
Do you dream? Do you?
Do you dream? Do you?
Do you dream?
