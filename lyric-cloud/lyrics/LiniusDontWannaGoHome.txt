Feelin’ psychedellic as the night unravels
Gotta keep on drinking ‘til I kiss the gravel
Never bout the past, yeah I put that in the shadow
Time to own the night, like my name is Jimmy Fallon

We keep on going ‘til the sunrise, so drunk I don’t even see the club lights
Prime time - I might end up on television
New Year’s everyday, what the f*ck I’m thinking?
What else can you expect from these humble beginnings?
Forget what momma said, degrade these bitches
Mothafuckas know my bars like it’s a religion
You can call me Jesus Christ with the love that I’m getting, hey!
Them haters wanna crucify me, but I don’t really care I’m just doing me
Feel like I been schoolin’ yall - class of elite
So before I begin you better stay in your seat, ey

‘Cause I don’t wanna go home, ey
‘Cause I don’t wanna go home
Got a bad bitch and a bottle of Patrón
All I’m really saying is I don’t wanna go home, ey

Got a bad bitch and a bottle of Patrón
All I’m really saying is I don’t wanna go home, ey

All I’m really saying is I don’t wanna go home, ey

Check me on cops that was just a couple days ago
Stole a couple jackets - I ain’t even broke
Smoke so much start to think it could be lethal
All up in the club with my money like a free throw
Couple different models singing my song
Too much steeze and I’m in my zone
Got a bad bitch, bottle of Patrón
All I’m really saying is I don’t wanna go home, ey
