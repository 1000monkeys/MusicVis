Caught in the middle of your web
Now your hands are red
Every word you said feels hollow
All of the promises you made
Are dead and washed away
Your smoke and mirrors won't change what I know

I know your secrets
I know your lies
I see the darkness
Living inside
There's nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
'Cause I know your secrets
I know your lies

Lost in the monster you've become
Now you're on the run
Living life behind the shadows
Crossed with a target on your head
Now you made your bed
Nothing left to say now

I know your secrets
I know your lies
I see the darkness
Living inside
There's nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
'Cause I know your secrets
Yeah, I know your secrets
I know your secrets
I know your lies

Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
I know your secrets
I know your lies
I know your lies
