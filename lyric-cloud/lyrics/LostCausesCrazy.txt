Wanna slow me down you
Wanna slow me down you
Wanna slow me down you
(Guess I’m going for a swim now)

Bet you going down for a walk
Now that I’m a star you wanna talk
Bitch get out my way imma boss
Bet you want a lot of my sauce
Wait a minute
Wait a  wait a minute
All the time talking trash wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a wait a minute
‘bout to blow this shit up
Wait a minute

I said wait a minute
When I come to the top you wait a minute
So why you wasting time look what Im bringing
Look what I’m bringing
A different thing yeah
You hear me now
I hear you talking and talking talk at me now
I keep on walkin’ and walkin’
A walk you can’t even cope with
You deep in blocking me stop it
Look at me now
So just be careful what you wishing now
Cause when you swim you may drown
You see me rising when you want me down
I guess you can’t see my crown
And if you can’t see my crown
I’ll raise my middle fingers for you now
I’ll raise my middle fingers for you now

Bet you going down for a walk
Now that I’m a star you wanna talk
Bitch get out my way imma boss
Bet you want a lot of my sauce
Wait a minute
Wait a  wait a minute
All the time talking trash wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a wait a minute
‘bout to blow this shit up
Wait a minute

Got the sauce so you feeling kind of wavy
You feel my shit now you looking kind of crazy
You got lost cause you thought I’d never make it
I'm flying to the top even tho you always hating
Forget it, I never forgot this shit
When I come in I’m bringing I’m bringing my own thing
So fuck you and your game
Fuck you bitch you lame
Told you we not the same
Guess you here for the fame
So just be careful what you wishing now
Cause when you swim you may drown
You see me rising when you want me down
I guess you can’t see my crown
And if you can’t see my crown
I’ll raise my middle fingers for you now
I’ll raise my middle fingers for you now

Bet you going down for a walk
Now that I’m a star you wanna talk
Bitch get out my way imma boss
Bet you want a lot of my sauce
Wait a minute
Wait a  wait a minute
All the time talking trash wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a wait a minute
‘bout to blow this shit up
Wait a minute
