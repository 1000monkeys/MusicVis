29 days
35 minutes
That's as long as I've been sober
I can't tell the fuckin' difference
I ain't find that peace of mind
I heard sobriety delivers
I'm dyin' the slowest death
Like cirrhosis of the liver

Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, roll me up a blunt
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, pour me up a drank
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
I learned nothin' from sobriety
So what's the fuckin' difference
I could really care less for another person's opinion

I just found out all niggas are alike
And it seems that every one of us is the same
I'm ashamed we're content with this slavery
Given today we're consentin' these diamonds and chains
Now that's a connection connectin' you right to the past
Those shackles they gave us for free
Can now cost you more than a house
An abundant amount of materialistic disease
But it seems that we're all just tryin' to be free and happy
Searching for peace of mind and a handful of factors
Coverin' insecurities with name-brand fashions
Then covet a lifestyle we couldn't even imagine
Designed by a dictator, fabricated by a fascist
You better get your seat-belt fastened
If this plane crash, go down in front of a million people
Where the HD camera lens flashes
Cheers for the happiness but standin' ovate for the tragic
Hand claps when they see a mothafuckin casket
Nigga was nothin' more than a bastard
Live on a plantation with figurative slave masters
Now I depict the vision so you can picture composite
Complicity sold souls to get the largest deposit
For cars that go fast and diamond encrusted watches
The life I live's a facade, mirage, nobodies watchin'
I'm hopin' music is more than the allure of dollars droppin'
Illuminated my mind mystifyin' euphoria
Rappin' 'bout imperfections to lace a sentence with purity
Hopin' to find salvation and glory amidst obscurity

For 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, roll me up a blunt
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, pour me up a drank
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
I learned nothin' from sobriety
So what's the fuckin' difference
I could really care less for another person's opinion

I, drift in-n-out of consciousness
Incompetent, tryin' to stay afloat
Conductin' myself with a certain rapport
The realest of rhymes for your mind to absorb
I'm ready for battle, preparin' for war
Condition my soul as the battle ensues
Alluding these evils that try to pursue
Like the voices I hear that could probably subdue
A political power that counter-produce
The proponents of owners perform, it's a duece
Confusions diluted the mind of the youth
While we runnin' in circles in search of a truth
Significant ignorance give us the glue
An omnipotent impotent imminent clue
The suicide note that I've written for you
Mixed with hateful content and insidious views
My soul is at peace with that sight of a pew
Damnation for many, salvation's for few
It's unfortunate fortunes of sins we've accrued
For a moment to fornicate
Sins of the father condemnin' the seed
Before it can prosper it failed to reprieve
But it's fillin' a voice for your venomous greed
Discriminately, considerin' me
Less than a man 'cause the wealth I received
Is a spirit of mind and materialized into my indiscretions
Like catholic confessions foretellin' sins of the fleshes
I'm writin' 'bout imperfections to lace my lyrics with purity
Hopin' to find salvation and glory amidst obscurity

For 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, roll me up a blunt
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
Fuck it, pour me up a drank
I bet that shit won't make a difference
Sober 29 days and 35 minutes
I learned nothin' from sobriety
So what's the fuckin' difference
I could really care less for another person's opinion
