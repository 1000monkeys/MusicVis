Last of devotion
Tune out the stunts
Tune in tomorrow
Here come the runts

Who wants to dance? Who wants to slow dance?
With that rabbit down the hole, rabbit down the hole
I want a chance, I want to slow dance
And trap that rabbit down the hole, rabbit down the hole

Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite (dynamite)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Who wants to dance? Who wants to slow dance?
To that racket down the hall, racket down the hall
Ooh, I want to dance, I want the last dance
And trap that racket down the hall, racket down the hall

Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite (dynamite)
Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite (dynamite)
Come on!

Seven sticks of dynamite, fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, fuse the morning fuse the night

Fuse the morning, fuse the night
Fuse the morning, fuse the night
Fuse the morning, fuse the night
Give me seven sticks of dynamite
