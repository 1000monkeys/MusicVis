I've been-I've been doin' this a long time. I mean, over half my life. So, it's-it's awesome for me to be able to put out music that people will actually hear, especially when you put this much time into somethin' that you love, somethin' that you have a passion for. That's just, that's motivation

I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated
I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, I

When I first started, never knew if they will listen (Ah)
But when I write, I produce passion, that's Mel Gibson (Hey)
If music is a disease, I promise I'm infected (Ah)
I dream on different levels of dreams—Inception (No)
And these beats are my playground, let the words play (Ah)
You ain't catch it? That's wordplay, now you're stuck on the word "play"
I'm all business, no suit on, but that's okay (Ah)
I will K.O. you (K.O.), if you come in my work space (Here yet?)
And don't you ever try to tell me I lack passion (Ah)
I'm a stand up guy, I promise you ain't laughin'
These rappers are slowin' the game down—bad traffic (Ah)
And how you gon' put me in a category of wack rapper?
Yeah, listen, I'm Hulk, I transform and I smash rappers
You sippin' on syrup, that doesn't mean you're a sick rapper
See, what it means is you gon' prolly get sick after
You don't like that I'm blunt or is it the fact that I smoke past ya?

Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
I ain't goin' nowhere (Nowhere), nowhere (Nowhere)

I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated
I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, I

I put work in this music, you think I'm makin' this up? (Nope)
If the songs ain't sharp, trust me they ain't makin' the cut (Get it)
You don't like it? I'm no teacher, but you'll learn to adjust
I'm my own worst critic, so, critics, step your hate game up
I'm a different breed of artist, I know how to survive (Ah)
You come into my lane, you better know how to drive
And I suggest you buckle up if you gon' come on this ride
No Johnny Cash, but some of y'all are walkin' the line
But you wrong though (Wrong though), y'all look curious (Ah)
Heath Ledger type of questions like, "Why so serious?"
And you want watered down lyrics?
 Well, I don't carry 'em (Ah)
I dig holes for these tracks, and then I slaughter and bury 'em
The motivation I got is on a whole different level
I treat these lines like court case, I don't wanna settle
And my lyrics are bullets, and they're aimin' at you
And I ain't talkin' Switchfoot when I dare you to move

Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
I ain't going nowhere (Nowhere), nowhere (Nowhere)

I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated
I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, I

Yo, when it comes to punches, you know I'ma land mine (Land mine) (Ah)
No, I said I'm a land mine
Don't step on me or you'll get blown sky high
And I don't mean secrets when I say to keep it in mind
That I'm ill with the words—too sick
They say I rap hungry (Ah), well, that's 'cause I'm starvin'—Diesel
That's why they callin' me Riddick-ulous (Ah)
'Cause the look in my eyes is different, woo (Ha ha ha)

Y'all ain't ready (You'll have to rewind that)
Y'all ain't ready (Rewind that back)
Y'all ain't ready (Ready), woo
Let's go! (Ah)

Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
I ain't going nowhere (Nowhere), nowhere (Nowhere)

I, I'm motivated, motivated
