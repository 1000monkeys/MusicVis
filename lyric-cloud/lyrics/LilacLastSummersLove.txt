Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
...Smile fades in the summer
...Smile fades in the summer X2

Crazy summer feel like I get dumber every year
At the same time I get stronger through the blood and tears
Last 3 summers I've been through a lot of shit
That's the story of ODiN now let me tell you about it
Went to Seoul in 2011, I was 19
In pursuit of K-Pop girls I was chasing my dreams
Made some friends and started drinking just to get outside
Shout-out Jean and Charles, I still remember every night
Also Roshuan and Ghesquiere and shout-out to Joe (and Jomz)
Sharing wisdom to a 막내 like a big bro
Met a Chinese girl and things started go downhill
I was heartbroken and broke, and broke I am still
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
Story ended way to early when it barely had begun
Went back to Sweden with the feeling that something had died
I felt older, I felt colder when I looked inside
Second summer I was grinding, felt half dead
Nothing interesting happened so let's skip ahead
I went back again and stuck around for 6 months
Swear that all the shit I did down there was sick son
Met some scary people, had the time of my life
Spent my nights at Monkey Beach, almost always high
Met another girl but this time shit got even worse
She moved away I had to stay I felt like I was cursed
Stopped going to school, I spent my money fast
Had some good nights but the good nights didn't seem to last
We were broke and down together, me and all my friends
Lotta love to Sam and Jimmy (and Tommy), had my back to the end
I remember how you paid for my last dinner
Been a long ass time, no longer feel like a beginner
I've been working, I've been practicing
While my friends are partying, I'm out in a cabin in the woods every day, recording
Rest assure though there will be a better time for us
When I get some money off the music I'mma show up
We will laugh and drink together just like old friends do
Just be patient, don't be waiting, I'mma call you
Once again, went back to Sweden but this time for good
Outta luck and outta money, I did all I could
Started grinding 7 days a week to pay the rent
Only dreaming that some day I could go back again
That was last year, that summer was the worst so far
Constantly reminded by the nights at Ho Bar
Then something happened one day on the subway
While making beats I was approached by a guy named PJ
Told me he would introduce me to a couple of his friends
That's how I finally met LilCrazy and then eventually the whole damn gang
...ooh one crazy summer


That's my story in a nutshell
Life is boring, I bring action Like Kurt Russel
Shout-out Bad Boy, master tutor of the Puzzle
All you need is sober thinking and some muscle
This where old stories end and where new begin
Host an orgy on the mattress, bring all of your friends
That's a whole different story though, I'll tell you later
Love & Pop the Sex Adventure of a Navigator
Still remember, will forever, I will live to tell
Heartache after heartache, Hello Kitty, Hello! Sandybell
I met Madoka and Hikaru on summer eves
Lost all that, had to go back way to the place I tried to leave
Now I'm up in Sweden feeling sorry for myself
We're still far from even, gotta find one for myself
So I drink and think of people that I hope remember
How we used to drink and kick it way before September
I am lost up in the world, still think of girls, still watching anime
Simple things will never stay and I don't need them anyway
Lost a shit, I'm on my way but who am I to complain, nothing will ever stay the same, so
I've been drifting for a year but as I'm standing here
With these trophies lotta sudden memories appear
Lotta handouts from my friends how I made it through
Yeah I made it through, did what I had to do, so

And ODiN went on to do great things
Fucked so many bitches
Popped so many bands
Oh so many bands
ODiN went on to have many crazy, crazy summers...
