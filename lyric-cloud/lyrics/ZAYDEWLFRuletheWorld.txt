No one ever told us
Where the easy part begins
The story that they sold us
Keeps us hanging from the end

So we'll keep on starting the fires
Thinking we'll smoke out the liars
We don't give up when we're tired
That isn't the way that I'm wired

Someday, someday
We're gonna rule the world
I know someday
We're gonna rule the world
Counting down to explosion
I hear the moment approaching
Someday, someday
We're gonna rule the world

Waiting avalanches
Are the calm before the fall
Lightning when it flashes
Tells the story of it all

So we'll keep on starting the fires
Thinking we'll smoke out the liars
We don't give up when we're tired
That isn't the way that I'm wired

We own the future
We own the future

Someday, someday
We're gonna rule the world
I know someday
We're gonna rule the world
Counting down to explosion
I hear the moment approaching
Someday, someday
We're gonna rule the world

Our blood runs cold like we're at war
Our eyes light up like a thunderstorm
There are no locked doors anymore

We own the future
We own the future
(We own the future)
(We own the future)

Someday, someday
We're gonna rule the world
I know someday
We're gonna rule the world
Counting down to explosion
I hear the moment approaching
Someday, someday
We're gonna rule the world

We own the future
Someday, someday, soon
We own the future
Someday
We own the future
Someday, someday, soon
We own the future
We're gonna rule the world
