Tell me if I'm right 'cause I've been thinking
Every time that you reply that you been drinking
'Cause the only time you think of me is when the sun is down
Pour another glass and keep on fuckin' me around
Woken by the window and I'm reminded that
My thoughts under my pillow containing memories of the
Places where we could have been if it were up to me
I guess that all your promises were just my fantasies

Now I'm addicted to the high you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken, oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

Remind me once again why I'm repeating
That we can't be more than friends
I'm just protecting myself from the possibility that you could turn me down
Thinking that I'm better off if I don't make a sound

So I'm addicted to the high you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken, oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

I promise, I promise, I promise myself I won't see you again
Won't answer your calls, no, not at all, or read any text that you send
I promise, I promise, I promise myself this will come to an end
'Cause I can't do this again

No, I can't quit you
No, no, no
I can't quit you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
No, I can't quit you
No, I just can't quit you
Na na, na na na na na na na
I can't quit you
Na na, na na na na na na na
I can't quit you, oh
I can't quit you
