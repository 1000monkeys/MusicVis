Hmm!
Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha, woah
Ha-ha-ha-ha
[Verse 1: Brian & 
Nick
]
I may run and hide
When you're screaming my name, alright!
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright!

All of our time spent
In flashes of light-ight-ight-ight
[Chorus: All & 
AJ
]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(Alright!)
[Verse 2: Nick & 
Brian
]
Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on!
Wishing I could thank you
In a different way, come on!

'Cause all of your time spent
Keeps us alive, yeah-hey-ah-ah
[Chorus: All & 
AJ
]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(Larger than life)
[Bridge: All & 
AJ
]
Oooh-oooh 
(hey-ah)
Oooh-oooh 
(that's right)
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive-ive-ive-ive-ive, yeah!
Every time we're down
You can make it right!

All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
[Interlude: AJ & 
All
]
Yeah
Every time we're down
Yeah
You can make it right
Yeah
That's what makes you larger than life
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus: All & 
AJ
]
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(That makes you larger than life)
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than life
 
(life)
