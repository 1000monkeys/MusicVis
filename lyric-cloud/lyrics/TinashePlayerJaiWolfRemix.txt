Live life like if I want, I do
If I want love, I get it, get it, I get it
Fooled me twice, if I fall for you
If I go there, forget it

So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
'Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
'Cause it ain't enough
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love

Playing with fire, if I burn, you do
If I hurt, you won't let it (you won't let it)
Stacked my deck like I ain't gon' lose
Like a victim, forget it

So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
'Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
'Cause it ain't enough
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love, love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
