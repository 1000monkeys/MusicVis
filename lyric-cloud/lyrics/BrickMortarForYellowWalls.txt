For yellow walls
We spent our days into the night together
We built the fire into the night
We let it burn forever
We fell in love, it fell apart, I put it back together
Tah oh-oh oh-oh
For ya
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
I feel so great but now I'm afraid
Tah oh-oh oh-oh
For ya
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
No place to live
No place to laugh
No place to love
Not ever
When I was young
Didn't see much
See much of love
Did ya
Oh-oh oh-oh
Did ya
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
I know I don't got much right now
For what I got, I'm proud
Are ya
Oh-oh oh-oh
Are ya
Oh-oh oh-oh
For yellow walls
We spent our days into the night together
We built the fire into the night
We let it burn forever
I feel so great, but now I'm afraid
Tah oh-oh oh-oh
Hey!
Wait! Don't misplace all your hate
Just learn to shift your shape
But now I'm so afraid
Of you
For yellow walls
We spent our days into the night together
We built the fire into the night
We let it burn forever
I feel so great but now I'm afraid
Tah oh-oh oh-oh
For ya
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
For ya
Oh-oh oh-oh
For ya
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
