I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Dan-d-dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Dan-d-dangerous
Dan-d-dangerous
Dan-d-dangerous
Dan-d-dangerous
Dan-d-dangerous

Dan-d-dangerous
