I can feel the pit still forming in my chest
I'm about to say some things that I'll regret
I've talked myself in circles all night long
And sleep through the morning

Is it my fault
Is it my fault
Is it my fault I can't keep these thoughts at rest
Is it my fault
If I can't calm myself down
They won't let me take a breath

Is it my fault
Is it my f-

Is it my fault
Is it my fault
Is it my fault I can't keep these thoughts at rest
Is it my fault
If I can't calm
Myself down
They won't let me take a breath

Keep counting change to buy myself some time
To sort them out I need a plastic mind
If I run away and change my name then maybe
I'll find a new perspective in time

Is it my fault
Is it my fault
Is it my fault I can't keep these thoughts at rest
Is it my fault
If I can't calm
Myself down
They won't let me take a breath

Is it my f-
Is it my f-

Is it my fault
Is it my fault
Is it my fault I can't keep these thoughts at rest
Is it my fault
If I can't calm
Myself down
They won't let me take a breath
