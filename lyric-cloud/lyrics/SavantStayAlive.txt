I know you love me
Please know I love you too
And all the ways you show me
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna stay alive
I just wanna stay with you
I just wanna stay alive (Oooh, baby)
Please let my wish come true

I'm just enjoying my day
Wonder if it go wrong (?)
I'm just lying in your bed, yeah yeah
Cause I'm alive
And nothing really matters
When you're all alone in bed

I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about

I just wanna stay alive
I just wanna stay with you
I just wanna stay alive (Oooh, baby)
Please let my wish come true

I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about
I've got nothing to worry about
