I been waitin' for your comeback like the summer (ohh)
That kind of weather just brings me back to you (ooh)
Mmm, you the type of love I just can't get a hold of (ohh)
Say the word and I'll be racin' back to you, you

You went bad, I got mad
I got back at you fast
Wish I could take it back
Is it too late now to take it back?

I admit that I was wrong
It should've been you all along
Turns out I can't go on
But the blame's on both of us
It should've been you all along
But we always get it wrong
Turns out it was both our fault
'Cause the blame's on both, on the both of us

We were playin' games that set us up to lose (ohh)
And even now I wanna play those games again, yeah (ooh)
Mmm, this a battlefield and I'm callin' a truce (ohh)
I got my white flag wavin' high for you, yeah, ohhh

You went bad, I got mad
I got back at you fast
Wish I could take it back
Is it too late now to take it back?

I admit that I was wrong
It should've been you all along
Turns out I can't go on
But the blame's on both of us
It should've been you all along
But we always get it wrong
Turns out it was both our fault
'Cause the blame's on both, on the both of us

I admit that I was wrong
It should've been you all along
Turns out I can't go on
But the blame's on both of us
It should've been you all along
But we always get it wrong
Turns out it was both our fault
'Cause the blame's on both, on the both of us
