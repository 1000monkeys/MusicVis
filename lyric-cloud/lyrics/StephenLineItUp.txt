Seven o’ five
Sunset drive
That’ll be a good time
Bourbon on ice
Payin' no mind
It’s gonna be a rude night
Those blue eyes
Walk by
She pulls me aside
And says to me
My ride is outside
My place is near by
Do you wanna leave?

I said
Babe if you want this
I should let you know
I’m looking for so much more
And I promise, if I take you home
I can’t say I’ll hold you tomorrow
Cause tomorrow I still won’t know you
Babe if you want this, you should let me go
Baby just let me go
And she line it up, line it up
And she line it up
Baby just let me go
And she line it up, line it up
And she line it up

Twenty-four flights
New high rise
Girl's got the good life
(Damn)
The look in her eyes
It's telling me why
It’s gonna be a long night
She pulls me inside
Turns off the lights
And says to me
I’m not your type
But just for tonight
We can make believe

I said
Babe if you want this
I should let you know
I’m looking for so much more
And I promise, if I take you home
I can’t say I’ll hold you tomorrow
Cause tomorrow I still won’t know you
Babe if you want this, you should let me go
Baby just let me go
And she line it up, line it up
And she line it up
Baby just let me go
And she line it up, line it up
And she line it up
