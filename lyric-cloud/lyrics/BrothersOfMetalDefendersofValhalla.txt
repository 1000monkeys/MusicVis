They can take away our lives
But they can never take our metal!
This is a tale of warriors – questing far and wide
A tale so true and glorious – it will turn the tide
Those who have seen us – either fled or died
And those who tell you otherwise – know that they have lied
We’re siblings of the North
Eight we’re standing strong
Adventuring across the realms to write this awesome song
On our quest for might and glory – foes will fall
Filling up our inventory – a potion of strength for all
We are warriors of the world
In our hearts we know what’s right
We will stand up for the weak
And bring the flames of courage – into the fight
Champions
Defenders of Valhalla, with glory we ride
Together, side by side
We strike down on evil with our all might
Guardians of light
With hammers of justice we will win the fight
Brothers and sisters unite
We will rise!
Nidhögg the dragon, gnawing at our tree
Defenders of Valhalla, we will banish thee
Sture the Stormborn, quick as one can be
Catching every squirrel and crush them with his knee
Agnar has fallen, he fought like a beast
If we all shall die today, tomorrow we will feast
Snorre, son of Sturla, the greatest skald he be
Telling tales of ancients, the future he could see
Champions
Defenders of Valhalla, with glory we ride
Together, side by side
We strike down on evil with all our might
Guardians of light
With hammers of justice we will win the fight
Brothers and sisters unite
We will rise!
Champions
Defenders of Valhalla, with glory we ride
Together, side by side
We strike down on evil with our all might
Guardians of light
With hammers of justice we will win the fight
Brothers and sisters unite
We will rise!
