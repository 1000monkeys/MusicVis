Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no

All that you'll need, I will give
All what you'll read, I will write
Don't end it, don't end it
All the time I will wait here
'til all I could see is out of sight
And all I will be is out of line
Don't end it, don't end it now
But all the time you'll go

When you're doing alright again
And you'd rather go, rather go on
Now you knew that our time would end
Then you'd better go, better go on
So I ruined your pride again
And you'd rather go, rather go on
Oh, I know you're right. I know you're right
Just don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no

All what you'll mean, I will get
And all that you seek I will find for you
Don't end it, don't end it
All my time I'll waste here
Why can't I be the one you need?
Why can't I be all your light?
Don't end it, don't end it now
But all the time you'll go

When you're doing alright again
And you'd rather go, rather go on
Now you knew that our time would end
Then you'd better go, better go on
So I ruined your pride again
And you'd rather go, rather go on
Oh, I know you're right. I know you're right
Just don't walk away, no
Oh, don't walk away, no
Oh, don't walk away, no
Oh, don't walk away, no

So this time we'll go
When you're doing alright again
And you'd rather go, rather go on
Now you knew that our time would end
Then you'd better go, better go on
So I ruined your pride again
And you'd rather go, rather go on
Oh, I know you're right. I know you're right
Just don't walk away, no

Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
Don't walk away, no
