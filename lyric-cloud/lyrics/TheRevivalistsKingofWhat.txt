You say every man's a king
King of what?
They say every man's a king
A king of what?
I got my bullets, bag and stone don't wake me up I'm in the zone
And I believe the trees not those innuendo seeds
Everything is light see no voodoo in the night
Hear no evil, fear no evil what's the reason for the fight?
If every man's a king
A King of what?
They say every man's a king
A king of what?
I can hear you on the other line tell stories from another time
Lawsuit love is all we know like fleeing dogs in heavy snow
Wait in wonder, watch in awe
Who we were is all we are
It's getting dangerous, dangerous
It's getting dangerous
You say every man's a king
King of what?
You say every man's a king
A king of what?
Of every step that he will take
Every move that he must make
Every waking moment he's alive
Every thought and spoken word
Laughter, sob or sigh he heard
Every ounce of love that's in his heart
He's a king
We are kings
