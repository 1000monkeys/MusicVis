Scenario number 1 this girl who I thought was the one invited me to her crib sayin' let's watch the Pacquiao fight come by it'll be fun! (Woohoo!)
I replied why not, I never go out anyways and it's her heart I'm tryna win for forever and everyday!
I make myself look fresh with the clothes that I had
Asked Uncle Nick for a nice pants, and a nice hat, and a white tank under a nice jacket, under a dress shirt
D.C. Shoes, anything new. (Damn!) It's 2010 so I had the skinny jeans too. (Swag swag swag.)
I walk through the front door and I noticed her new hair, and fuckin' there was another dude there... (Who the fuck is this guy?)
Like come on I thought it was only you here, they buzzin' off the root beer, oh dear, she brought me so she could feel loved
I came because I wanted love, instead I got tickets to a flirt fest and what's worse is the guy had a girlfriend
And she said, um, hehe. I don't mean to be rude, oh, are those new shoes?
It's really cute. Anyways, could you get me and my friend here a plate of food? I got up and I was like, alright......

Here we go yo! Here we go yo!

Scenario number 2, this is how it started
I'm at a college party in a dark room where the dance floor is super naughty
Hardly could see at all but this girl was drunk as bananas and asked for a water bottle
I holla cross the hall and said I got em! (I got 'em!)
I had to cuz if she vomits, the deposit is lost profit
I bring it to her and said there's a bathroom near the kitchen
She said, listen, homie. You don't know me
I have intuition that you could've slipped in a pill or two in the bottle you're givin
How do I know getting in my pants isn't your mission? (Tryna get in my pants huh?)
I said well, cuz the caps closed
She said you one of those persistent frat hoes!
I said no, I'm Risk Management the jobs to fix damages by all you under the influenced savages who could possibly leave with bandages
She's like what the fack is this you are such a creep! Good thing I wasn't asleep!
I said sorry I don't want to harm ya, I'll back off and stay far from ya
Next thing you know, a big hunk of a guy bumped into her, feelin' her thighs, bent her over the sink and was dry humping her from behind
I thought I was a pervert what the hell?! And he got her number...

Here we go yo! Here we go yo!

Scenario number 3, final scenario, kinda scary though
Cause it brings back past memories that I buried so so deep in the attic of my noggin
We were on and offin' like a light switch thinking she might switch but I was using energy
Afraid I would lose everything:
A beautiful woman hiding a lonely soul, the timing was ugly but what do you know?
I was ignorant to it like terms and conditions. Cuz we ended on bad terms and conditions
I should've read the way the relation-ship was sinking
I wasn't thinkin'
I was indifferent to the signs I just keep missing em like a game of darts, aimed at my heart bullseye every time bullshit that it was I
And what's horrifying is I still think it's my fault
I opened up, I loved me enough for the both of us
I should've had a better wardrobe
I should've drank those 4 Locs
I shouldn't keep these doors closed
I know she played me 4 times but there's good in everything right?
I know these times were in high school but I remember it like, it was yesterday night
It affected my psych because I started to lead women on end up leaving them because I was afraid of commitment
I'm such a fucking idiot
But I didn't have sex with them or nothing cuz I believed in the one
I guess I was seeing women to see if I could still be with at least one
Hold up, dang it Abby's calling me

You know I know I ain't good enough
You going all in I'm still pullin bluffs
Withcho good hands, you fold them closed over mine, showin' mercy cuz I thought I couldn't cuff
You the W between the two of us
You the butterfly I caught in my net
The same one that make my stomach upset
You're the groceries I'll make second trips for. (Ha!)
Like my boy Mark terrified of unconditional love
You're the dove of my life you're the pitiful drug
Need a dose every night
Am I even your type?
I like squeezin' you close
Electrical plug I'm needing you most when I'm dying
Trying to synchronize with a partner past 19 years
I had to fight these fears, dry these tears, try these beers, drove me nuts, drive me, steer me clearly
Weary road, but I see clear. Here we are now

I'm a little bit of crazy
I'm a little bit of a fool
I'm a little bit of lonely
I'm a little bit of all I need a cure
Just a little bit of you and I will fall

I'd be honored if you called me your soldier
Lay you on the sofa
Lotion all over your shoulders in motion, that's my present for ya
Present in the moment, nowhere else I gotta be and more focused!
I'm you're one and only, you're my only cobra, love can bite back but we'll never end up broken
My heart you stole it, stowed it on a stove and scorched it to the point my love for you's never, frozen
Corny ass dude that you chosen!
You gotta put up till we older
Oh well, you're open mind, what I love the most cuz you're down to ride Toyota Corollas and Range Roves
Roller coasters of emotions, hopeless tears that turned oceans
I'm ready to go through it all
Taking the world ain't right without you involved
Taking the world ain't right without you involved

I'm a little bit of crazy
I'm a little bit of a fool
I'm a little bit of lonely
I'm a little bit of all I need a cure
Just a little bit of you and I will fall

They say if you ain't look crazy then it ain't real
Why hide when sooner or later you gotta reveal
I'm fine with swooping for take out from tryna conceal, a fine dine, silver spoon on the table and popular meals
Be honest, ya feel? I'm happy I chose you
