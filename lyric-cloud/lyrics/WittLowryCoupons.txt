A couple more bills are here
You tell me don't worry, you
Coupons on the table, we're
Tryna find a way to buy food
And I'm feeling so lost out here, I run to you
And I'm feeling so lost out here, I run to you, run to you
Running is something youâ€”

And I had to know well
Honestly, no scars that I won't tell
Honestly scared to death that I won't sell
I ain't worried 'bout the money, go to benefit the hungry
It's a feeling that I know we both felt
And I ain't no help, 'cause I'm trying to live a dream
And it means that it seems I got no wealth
And we know hell, seen it twice
Looks somethin' like a bottle with a glass of ice
It looks somethin' like a house over half our life
It looks somethin' like a letter turning off the lights
We can't pay the price
How am I gon' write at night with no lights? And I want it more
I see you charge another bill that you can't afford
And so I pray for the day I can say that I gave you
More, gave you more
Open that door, you know you deserve it
And one day in the future we'll realize where all of the pain, it was worth it
And I'll get you that house out in Florida with Gizmo, the view will be perfect
You should know that I feel like you raised me alone because Daddy was worthless
Never was working, drunk on the couch
I'm almost ashamed that I came from you now
You finally got sober, you figured it out
But you sit and you pout, no one's ever around
Wearin' a cap and a gown for sobriety found
And forget about years of you letting me down
I'm surrounded by people who care 'bout me now
Now I'm cuttin' you out and I like how it sounds

Now, I know that we've been through it all
No, we don't fall, nobody can break us
'Cause you believe in me, believe in me that I'm gon' make it
And I promise on my bones, I've built this home, I've built it up for you
Just know I built it all for you
Yeah, I know that we've been through it all
No, we don't fall, nobody can break us
'Cause you'll believe in me, believe in me that I'm gon' make it
And I promise on my bones, I've built this home, I've built it up for you
Just know I built it all for you

And on top of it all, you call my phone
"Mark, the car broke while driving home"
Just found out we gotta leave our home
You see, I'm tryna pay the bills and this student loan
You see, I could have signed a deal, but I wanna keep it real
I can barely buy a meal, got me feeling broke
Until I'm sittin' on a bill, I ain't worried bout a mill
Know I'm hopin' that I'm bringin' to the people hope
They used to laugh and joke, they used to push me down
I had to find my soul inside a lost and found
Would have been better off without a dad around
I know it's sad to say, but can you blame me now?
Can you blame me now? Yellin' and screamin'
Alcohol over us, what were you thinking?
I'm tired of watching you drinking
And I tried to be nice, okay now I'm hoping to sink in
And when there was nothing to eat, I had friends who were feedin' me dinner
Drive to your house, stomach would growl
Open the door and you notice I been getting thinner
Been working all winter, been losing my mind
I've been stuck in my room analyzin' my lines
And the weight on me dropping my music on time
When you see me on Twitter, you think that I'm fine, but
Me, I'm tryna get to know me
Momma working at a two jobs OT
We got two things in common, we fight and believe
Now I'm trimmin' the leaves on the family tree
I don't do this for me, me, I do this for we
We got passion and heart, we're a part of a team
All I need is a mic and a Mac and a beat
We're a fraction of what we could actually be

Now, I know that we've been through it all
No, we don't fall, nobody can break us
'Cause you believe in me, believe in me that I'm gon' make it
And I promise on my bones, I've built this home, I've built it up for you
Just know I built it all for you
Yeah, I know that we've been through it all
No, we don't fall, nobody can break us
'Cause you believe in me, believe in me that I'm gon' make it
And I promise on my bones, I've built this home, I've built it up for you
Just know I built it all for you

Just know I built it all for you, just know I built it all for you
Just know I built it all for you, no one can break us down, no no
Just know I built it all for you, just know I built it all for you
Just know I built it all for you, no one can break us down, no no
Just know I built it all for you
