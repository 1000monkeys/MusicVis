I’m looking at the smoke as it goes 'round
And I don’t ever think this will burn out
How we still glowing
How we still glowing

Yeah, they said that we’d all turn to ashes
But you shake it off all relaxed
And you keep it going
You keep it going

I know that the flames won’t stop us
When the rain really starts to drop
Yeah, I know that the flames don’t stop cause

Baby, you’re a wildfire
Running through my veins
Every little step I take closer to you
I can feel the sparks lighting up in the room
Baby, you’re a wildfire
Still dancing 'round my brain
Everytime I catch you’re looking at me
I can feel the rush from my head to my feet

I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
Baby, you’re a wildfire
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go

Baby, you’re a wildfire
Running through my veins
Every little step I take closer to you
I can feel the sparks lighting up in the room
Baby, you’re a wildfire
Still dancing 'round my brain
Everytime I catch you’re looking at me
I can feel the rush from my head to my feet

Baby, you’re a wildfire
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
Baby, you’re a wildfire
I’m never gonna let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
Baby, you’re a wildfire
