I’m too tired to sleep when I’m in the dark
Afraid of what might haunt my heart
I’ve been waiting here for so long
When your the only one that I’ve been
Dreaming of
Oh, oh, oh
Your skins electric, my hearts magnetic baby
I will never let you go
My soul is hurting, your touch is burning baby
I will never let you go
Your skins electric, my hearts magnetic baby
I will never let you go
My soul is searching, your touch is burning
Baby
I will never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
My heart ‘cause it’s in my hand
I’ve been waiting here for so long
When your the only one that I’ve been
Dreaming of
Your skins electric, my hearts magnetic baby
I will never let you go
My soul is hurting, your touch is burning baby
I will never let you go
Never let you go
I’m too tired to sleep when I’m in the dark
Afraid of what might haunt my heart
I’ve been waiting here for so long
When your the only one that I’ve been
Dreaming of
Your skins electric, my hearts fluorescent baby
I will never let you go
My soul is hurting, your touch is burning baby
I will never let you go
Your skins electric, my hearts magnetic baby
I will never let you go
My soul is searching, your touch is burning baby
I will never let you go
Never let you go
Your skins electric, my hearts fluorescent baby
I will never let you go
My soul is hurting, your touch is burning baby
I will never let you go
Your skins electric, my hearts magnetic baby
I will never let you go
