Birds eye low tide views we on somethin'
We ain't have no fives highs was all funded
Days we had to sacrifice happiness for sleepin'
Lost a couple rounds know the future wasn't bleak then
Meet me at the beach baby throwback like it's 0-2 ('02)
At least now I could never owe no one
Watch I'll do it on my own two
Feet they don't want me be the throne no more
People at my neck for me to drop
Been that way since I moved out the crib on Lofton
She said baby find a way I'll do the talkin'

And maybe you you don't know what you want but you comin' back For more
Back for tour
Bad for me bad for lore
Bad for everything made with remorse
So baby tell me how you do your walk like that
I see the truth is costin'
More than talkin over's gotten
Saying more than loving you has gotten me a prophecy

Too much to say in altercations
Show em at the night show
They say it's hard to make it whoa
That ain't what I'm waitin for
No Noooo
And too much to say (x2)
Can't put it away no more
No going back
No steppin back

And all the people want me runnin' from Bombay to Pompeii
Take up all my time
And every second that I'm thinking the same thing the same day
I lose another second of gameplay
I want it all since I was seven lost it all eleven up I'll
Sleep when I'm in heaven that's when I know I've become
Exactly what they ain't wanted to see (aye)
Exactly what they ain't wanted for me (yeah)
I been runnin' s***
I been lovin' this
I'm in love with your goals, goals
I ain't had nothin' but
Now I been fundin' it
I ain't got time for these h***, h***
Negatives were nothin but we turned it into something and
Silent as that s*** goes, goes
We gon' have it bumpin have the whole city jumpin' and
I been runnin' it home
