Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
I got a lot on my mind
I want to tell you I'm wrong
I want to tell you that I fucked up
I'm gonna tell you the truth

A fist to purple your eyes
It's going to hurt for a time
But if you let me I'll give you a ride
Oh my
Oh my

It's my fault that you
It's my fault that that you
It's my fault that you
It's my fault that that you

It's my fault that you're walking away
I told you ten times I'm gonna change
I don't blame you thinking, I'm full of it
If you let me honey, I will become
Your safety, shade tree, favourite song
I don't need this crazy, cause I'm over it
Yeah, cause I'm over it

And I thought that it would change
But you gave me a reason to stay away
We stay the same, and I think about the fall
You gave me a reason to want it all
We never win

It's my fault that you're walking away
I told you ten times I'm gonna change
And I don't blame you thinking, I'm full of it
If you let me honey, I will become
Your safety, shade tree, favourite song
I don't need this crazy, cause I'm over it
Yeah cause I'm over it

Cause I'm over it
