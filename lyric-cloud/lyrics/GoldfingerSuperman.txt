So here I am
Doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am
Pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to keep
The ground on my feet
It seems the world is falling down around me
The nights are all long
I'm singing this song
To try and make the answers more than maybe

And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away

So here I am
Growing older all the time
Looking older all the time
Feeling younger in my mind
And here I am
Doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am
Pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to sleep
I lost count of sheep
My mind is racing faster every minute
What could I do more
Yeah, I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles but I can't quit

And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away

Controlling everything in sight
Feeling weak I don't feel right
You're telling me I have to change
Telling me to act my age
But if all that I can do
Is just sit and watch time go
Then I'll have to say good-bye
Life's too short to watch it fly
So watch it fly

So here I am
Growing older all the time
Looking older all the time
Feeling younger in my mind
And here I am
Doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am
Pretending I'm a superman
