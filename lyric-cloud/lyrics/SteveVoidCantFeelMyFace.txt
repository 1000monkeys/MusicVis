Well, it seems like you've finally decided to visit us here
At the Death Dimension

Ayeeee
Niggas better cut dat dripp
Ridin round town wit a brand new whip
Souf side niggas comin up from da six
Can't ride my vibe can't catch my trip
Aye
Bitch better pay mah biilllsss
Brand new crib wit a house on da hillss
I get my caddle n saddle uppp
I get my caddle n saddle upp

Po 2 up finna po mo
And I pulled up in a 4 do
Rags to the riches at the cornasto
Get a bag fuckin bitches
Dey ain't know me doe

Mask off nigga gon see me
Black ball nigga i’m dc
Bitches on vogue nympho
Tippin on 4s slim hoe

Kick thru the door get the stick to talkin
Wrinkle my nose then I get to walkin
Closer to 9 I’m a hellcat
Spirits and fumes can you smell that?

Sleep in the whip 'fore i call the kin
Sense cig smoke when i walk in
Nah i ain't paid but i'm still fresh
Reverse red rum when i smell flesh

Kenny keep it cool
Want my dollas blue
I would keep tha tool
Jus to deal wif u
Now im runnin w tha loot
Ion wanna truce
When im off tha goose
I be green like bruce

Nigga get dis money you ain’t no threat ain’t no peepin me
Ye haw see me seesaw goin retard nigga not worried how you feel bout me

Yosimite sam so pissed
Rolled up quick almost broke my wrist
Two tone rollie gon n quote yo bitch
We ain’t no homie, no photo bitch

Crossin the street with the key to the city
Next to the sea, but the ghetto still gritty
No they ain’t straight but my teeth ima shine em
Don’t look for too long the stones they might blind ya

Need shades when i blind you
Bitch don't look behind you
Go check in yo closet
We still gon go find you
We ring em like frodo
This evil eye know yo deepest darkest secrets the truth

Ho dont tell me what to do
Aries gang lost my cool
Choppin roofs you a coupe
When u rude to tha crew

Ayeeee
Niggas better cut dat dripp
Ridin round town wit a brand new whip
Souf side niggas comin up from da six
Can't ride my vibe can't catch my trip
Aye
Bitch better pay mah biilllsss
Brand new crib wit a house on da hillss
I get my caddel n saddle uppp
I get my caddle n saddle upp


Take the bus to the campus still skip classes
Raps in my head like experimental rat tests
Look professor do u know who u talking to
Lil broke boy do u know what im plotting fool
Been a god bitch check my dna
So the rap group name fit real okay
Tell a friend lil bitch do u see who on stage
Ain't that tony tone from back in the day
Only man on my block with a gold chain on
And rings on my fingers like mj dawg
Use to take pics now they wanna snap me up
Same fit everyday in ya face double d cup
Been to jail bitch and i ain't goin back
Thanks to joe jack my life on track
Lap a track like earnheart
Earned my stripes now the worlds ours

Nigga its me in a rental showin off my dentals blowin out dis indo
I can’t bend my middle finger
Ill make a mess outta anything yuh
Holdin that bitch up like simba
Like she a pin up
Love how i enter her
Pull my flow from dimensions that
Made niggas make dem billions
Steve jobs floatin out tha coffin
Call god on my cellular
On my momma im a monster
Yes i been to hell and back
Converse dirty sneakers better make suree i look fresh as fuck
If run my check again ill spend it on a bentley truck

Big Body Boykin been workin on a bag bitch
Hopped up off my porch and put my face into some cash bitch
Crackin down on niggas startin plex with me from last year
I don’t know how cash feel, but I’m making racks still
She just popped an Advil
Cause these niggas wack still
Told her bring her ass up to my room to see how black feel
I don’t need no rest until my soul leave at the last bell
I’ll enjoy my last dish
Life ain’t but a bad bitch

Vintage on ya tee
Tryna get like me
Boi you buss yo knees
Tryna jig like me
Smokin the indica
Till eyes is sinister
Lightning bolt syndicate fuck up the place
Thought it was a joke till them niggas realized no sheath no disguise
Put bands in my waist
Put a wish on star that I run land and space
Lit the end of the gar then I run plan trail blaze
You couldn’t do it
Prolly a bitch
Live life so lucrative seen as a myth
Always on stupid shit
Karma gon flip
They gone switch up the minute I buss down my wrist ay
3 points made when I cocked back fifth misery put to shame double cross you get hit
Put yo lip on blast
Like a Jenner hashtag
Goal insist that I’m rad
Pump assist to the bag yuh

Tuck that chain for you buck at gang
Give a fuck bout lip or what a bitch think
Caught wit that dick my shooter his main
Come with them clips like kunta kinte
Fresh off bail built the cell myself
Ima flex that bih put that shit on my back
Sold myself like a dummy did that
No money off rap eyes deep in these bags
Out the mud south back bwoy
Count drac mount that board
Took a lil time just to fill that void
If it sound quite white ion’t hear that noise
Big tex, run me that check
Splurge one time spent that on my neck
Run that hoe back part 2 of this quest
Bitch don’t play get right or get hexed
