Did you ever think
That we would be standing here
Did you ever think we would?
Did you ever blink
And everything just disappear
Did you ever thing we could?

Let me show you how to be a dreamer
Let me show you how to chase down the sun
No looking back when you’re a dreamer
Yeah this is where we will overcome

Higher than high
Higher than we ever knew that we could go
Maybe we’ll fly
Farther than the stars ever thought they could know

It’s all looking up now
It’s all looking up now we won’t stop
It’s all looking up now
Higher than high we won’t stop

When I hear you say
“It’s hard to keep from looking back”
Sometimes I think that too
Yeah I know it’s tough
When every day is grey and black
But I’ll keep on lifting you

Let me show you how to be a dreamer
Let me show you how to soak up the sun
You gotta keep walking on when you’re a dreamer
And I know that we will soon overcome

Higher than high
Higher than ever knew that we could go
Maybe we’ll fly
Farther than the stars ever thought they could know

It’s all looking up now
It’s all looking up now we won’t stop
It’s all looking up now
Higher than high we won’t stop

Yeah we’ve been coming up
Just coming up
Yeah who knew
Now we are standing on top
Yeah we’ve been coming up
Just coming up
Yeah who knew
Now we are standing on top

Higher than high
Higher than ever knew that we could go
Maybe we’ll fly
Farther than the stars ever thought they could know

It’s all looking up now
It’s all looking up now we won’t stop
It’s all looking up now
Higher than high we won’t stop
