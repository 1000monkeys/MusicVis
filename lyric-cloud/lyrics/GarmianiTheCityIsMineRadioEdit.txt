When the street lights come on
And the freaks come out at night
We cross bridges till the break of dawn
The city in my heart
So when you look up in the darkest night
Right under the stars
Just remember that you're not alone
You're not alone!
The city is mine-i-i-ine, i-i-ine
The place where I-I-I-I wanna be!
The city is mine-i-i-ine, i-i-ine
The city is mine, mine, mine, mine!
Where memories are born (born)
And the streets are full of life (life)
We cross bridges til the break of dawn (dawn, dawn)
The city in my heart!
So when you look up in the darkest night
Right under the stars
Just remember that you're not alone
You're not alone!
The city is mine-i-i-ine, i-i-ine
The place where I-I-I-I
The city is mine-i-i-ine, i-i-ine
The city is mine, mine, mine, mine!
The city is mine!
