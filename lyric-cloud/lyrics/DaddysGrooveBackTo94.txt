No where to go, to take our loving hearts
Cause I know, it's nothing here
No where to dance under the shooting stars
Cause we know it's nothing here
Remember the times when we went all the way
We never went home, wanted the crowd to stay
If there's somewhere go, to take our loving hearts
Let me know, I'll be right there

Can we go back to 94, go straight back to 94
When we all hang out, no we didn't mind
Wanna go back to 94, go straight back to 94
When we went all out, oh the time flew by
Oh if we take back the night, we don't have a care in the world
If we go back to 94, go straight back to 94
Then we go all out
Then we go all out

Then we go all out

It's still in my memory like a photograph
And I know that all we been
Was going and rocking like a Rolling Stone
Making stories, all we lived
Remember the times when we went all the way
We never went home, wanted the crowd to stay
If there's somewhere go, to take our loving hearts
Let me know, I'll be right there

Can we go back to 94, go straight back to 94
When we all hang out, where we didn't mind
Wanna go back to 94, go straight back to 94
When we went all out, oh the time flew by
Oh if we take back the night, we don't have a care in the world
If we go back to 94, go straight back to 94
Then we go all out
Then we go all out
Then we go all out
