Dark night
Still feeling dead inside
Everything could be alright
But only thing I need is you by my side

If I could do, I could do, I could do anything to make you mine
I would try, I would try, I would try, because you make me leave my problems behind
If I could do, I could do, I could do anything to make you smile
I would try, I would try, I would try, because now I just don't feel alive

Oh baby, if I had a power, I'd make you happy every hour
'Cause only thing I need is you by my side
Only if I could be the one, I'd bring you stars, I'd bring you sun
'Cause you're the only thing that keeps me alive

Can't deny
I know I'm not perfect, and I don't deserve it
But only if I could make you mine
I would hold you close, would have you by my side

If I could do, I could do, I could do anything to make you mine
I would try, I would try, I would try, because you make me leave my problems behind
If I could do, I could do, I could do anything to make you smile
I would try, I would try, I would try, because now I just don't feel alive

Oh baby, if I had a power, I'd make you happy every hour
'Cause only thing I need is you by my side
Only if I could be the one, I'd bring you stars, I'd bring you sun
'Cause you're the only thing that keeps me alive
