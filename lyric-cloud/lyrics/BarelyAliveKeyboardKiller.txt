Where's my laptop?
Gotta give these guys a piece of my mind

#ihateyou
I hope you get dropped from your label
I hope you're eatin' out with your family and your food falls off the table
Hope somebody cuts your cable
Hope your kid falls out his cradle
Cuz your music's pushing my buttons
And my button pushing is fatal
I'm a keyboard killer (killer)
Keyboard killer
But I gotta log out at 6 cuz my mom's making me dinner
Hope next time when you're driving, you get hit from the side
And you lie on the concrete dying, screaming "barely alive"

Hate, hate, hate, hate
I'm hatin', I'm hatin', I'm hatin'
I got hate in my heart
I got time on my hands
Got Call of Duty on pause
So I can write you a rant
I follow all of your pages
I read all of your posts
Nobody knows you like I do
But still I hate you the most (wait, uhhh)
