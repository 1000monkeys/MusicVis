Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler,

I got to throw on and go on
You know I got to flow on, selectors on ya, radio play us
Cause we're friendly for ozone but that's not all so hold on
Tight as I rock the mic right, oh, excuse me, pardon
As I synchronize with the analysed upcoming vibes
The session, let there be a lesson, question
You carry protection 
or will your heart go on
Like Celine Dion,
 
Karma Chameleon

Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone

Ambitious, nutritious, delicious, delirious or vicious
