Tell me, tell me, is this thing on now?
I've been working long like a marathon now
Tying up words making them a bomb now
Tell me, tell me, who turned on the alarm now?
I got a message, went and put it in a song now
I'll see you later, all the haters got it wrong now
We're touching the lightning
We're coming alive yeah
We feel it inside yeah
We got, we got, we got the power
Yeah, come on
We got, we got, we got the power
Yeah, turn it up
We got, we got, we got the power
Come on, come on, is everybody with me?
It's time to get together no more enemies
Throw your hands up, can you feel the energy?
Come on come on, can you finally hear what this means?
Twenty-something years, been chasing down this dream
Running like a wild man, going since fifteen
We're touching the lightning
We're coming alive yeah
We feel it inside yeah
We got, we got, we got the power
Yeah, come on
We got, we got, we got the power
