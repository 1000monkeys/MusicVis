Somebody told me you had given up on your smile
That must mean you've been pretending now for a while
To me, you don't have to keep hiding away who you are
Remember how we said together we would go far

Summer nights side by side
Oh, I know you remember how we laughed until we cried

So when you're down and out from your troubled life
I will be dying for you, dying for you
When all you have is doubt, know that I'm around
I will be dying for you, dying for you
So when you're down and out from your troubled life
I will be dying for you, dying for you
When all you have is doubt, know that I'm around
I will be dying for you, dying for you

Dying for you, yeah, dying for you
I'll be dying for you

You kept on changing your colors to be someone else
But you know some paintings should never, ever be changed

Summer nights side by side
Oh, I know you remember how we laughed until we cried

So when you're down and out from your troubled life
I will be dying for you, dying for you
When all you have is doubt, know that I'm around
I will be dying for you, dying for you
So when you're down and out from your troubled life
I will be dying for you, dying for you
When all you have is doubt, know that I'm around
I will be dying for you, dying for you

I'll be dying for you
I will be dying for you, yeah, dying for you, dying for you
I will be dying for you, yeah, dying for you
I'll be dying for you
