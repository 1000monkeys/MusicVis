They called it modern love
I call it giving up
We're running out of space
The cracks are in the screen
The data's never clean
I think we'll be replaced

This is my perfect holiday
I don't need my knees to pray
I'm checking out, going back
That's my holiday
And on my perfect holiday
I won't need my hands to say
I'm breaking out, I don't care
That's my holiday

If you could break the chain
And pull us back again
From the nightmares that we faced
Then I will take the reigns
And lead us through the pains
And the joys of being erased

This is my perfect holiday
I don't need my knees to pray
I'm checking out, going back
That's my holiday
And on my perfect holiday
I won't need my hands to say
I'm breaking out, I don't care
That's my holiday

They are all the same
But we can break the chain
The pleasure's in the pain
If I come back again
You'll know just who I am
The kid who got away

This is my perfect holiday
I don't need my knees to pray
I'm checking out, going back
That's my holiday
And on my perfect holiday
I won't need my hands to say
I'm breaking out, I don't care
That's my holiday
