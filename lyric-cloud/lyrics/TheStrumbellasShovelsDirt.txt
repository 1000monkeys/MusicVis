Mama never told 'em there's a devil in me
I got a mouth full of rotten and a heart full of greed
Shovels and dirt, shovels and dirt
Well, it ain't worth living if you don't get hurt
Alright!

Cowboy hats and crooked teeth
With a six shooting pistol just out of my reach
Shovels and dirt, shovels and dirt
Well, it ain't worth living if you don't get hurt

I got a head full of darkness and darkness is good
'Cause if we all die young, then we don't get hurt
Alright!

Well, demons pull me side to side again
Yeah, but I'm scared of sleeping, I hate my friends
Shovels and dirt, shovels and dirt
Well, it ain't worth living if you don't get hurt

I got a head full of darkness and darkness is good
'Cause if we all die young, then we don't get hurt
I got a head full of darkness and darkness is good
'Cause if we all die young, then we don't get hurt

I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky
It keeps us moving, it keeps us moving
I put a banjo up into the sky

I got a head full of darkness and darkness is good
'Cause if we all die young, then we don't get hurt
I got a head full of darkness and darkness is good
'Cause if we all die young, then we don't get hurt

Mama never told 'em there's a devil in me
I got a sick shooting pistol and I'm ready to leave
