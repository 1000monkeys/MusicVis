Hey, yeah
Hell I know how it is sometimes
You're holding on trying to forget them all night
Till you're drunk and you text that other ex
The one that said that they'd be there when you needed them

Peace of mind
Don't waste your time with looking back
They're broken pieces of past
Come here and make some love that
Make some love that

Lasts, lasts, lasts
You can't hide
Come make some love that
Lasts, lasts, lasts
You can't hide
Come make some love that lasts

You lay back
Cold shower with the music on
Hoping the sounds will drown them out till you're sober now
Fighting the thoughts that you will never be in love
That you will never feel at all from this time on

Here I am
Don't waste your time with looking back
They're broken pieces of past
Come here and make some love that
Make some love that lasts
Lasts, lasts, lasts
You can't hide
Come make some love that

Lasts, lasts, lasts
You can't hide
Come make some love that
Lasts, lasts, lasts
You can't hide
Come make some love that lasts
