They told me I can’t come to London and rap about drugs!
Let’s get that understood!
I say, “Why not? I know how to 
rock everywhere
 just like a hustler should!”
Even if London was sober - nigga, I’m from the ‘hood!
As long as real niggas in the building, then I’m 
fuckin’ good!
Aye, and as long as y’all got some bad bitches, then I’m 
fuckin’
 good!
It’s T-Top versus Iron Solomon
The rules changed, I’m hopin’ this time you follow ‘em
You move wrong, I will knock Iron out of it!
Or flame the metal: I’m tryna make Iron 
out of him
!
I’m doubtin’ him
Sorry, but I gotta offend you
The whole culture is tired of bein’ tolerant wit’ you
You Jewish, right? So you should feel this line when it hits you:
I’ll be the first to put one in Solomon temple!
Like, do I 
gotta
 convince you?
Bitch, a hollow will 
split
 you!
I give him 9, then take it back like the size didn’t fit you!
Nah, that line was too simple
‘Cause, see, I ride wit’ the 
pistol
Whip him, then bring it back like I’m drivin’ a rental!
Nigga! Nigga! Nigga!
BITCH! BITCH! BITCH!
Dawg, I can supply what you into
Weight, dimes, or the nickels
One sniff’ll open your mind like you tryna be liberal!
I’m a trapper, I done touched a lot of cash, Iron
Dope-slinger, I even cooked inside a cast-iron
We seen the movie
You barely made it in that 
Bodied
 cast, Iron
Well, when I’m shootin’ clips, they gotta make his 
body cast iron!
I’ll blast Iron!
Bitch nigga, you better call your team
Two cannons blackin’ on Iron Man like the War Machine!
He said he comin’ with that 
big poppa
? It was all a dream
‘Cause they ain’t know Iron got 
pressed
, ‘til they saw the 
steam!
I’m from the ‘Quay, where niggas keep the two-tone clappin’
You could get an extra five years for school-zone trappin’
Where a fuck nigga will die if he lose those habits!
And they’ll YouTube your murder if the news don’t grab it
But you a faggot, ‘cause you been scared of Webster Hall since your last bang-up
The embarrassment cost more than what Smack paid ya
You had your- Facts!
You had your bitch in the building: a hat-hanger
He took his boo off the stage like a bad singer
They told him, “Battle Tay Roc”
He said, “The 
Black Ranger?
They love every bar he spit! I’ll be in 
mad
 danger!
I’ll pass, player! Just gimme my cash later”
Shoulda known a Jewish man would be scared of a gas chamber
BOW! Shoot him straight in his mouth
I heard he talk the talk
I told Smack I need me a 
killer
, so this is all your fault
I asked for 
du-rags & Timbs
: New York, New York!
They gave me 
Broadway & films
: “New York, New York”!
Aye, I walk the walk, you the drive-thru kind
Bitch, I be posted outside like the drive-thru sign
Shotgun, barrel longer than the drive-thru line
And I gotta keep it low like the drive-thru time!
We palm 
biscuits!
I’ll shoot up his car if his broad in it
I run down on both y’all like, “Be calm, bitches.”
If I detect her (detector) goin’ off like the alarm trippin’
I’ll still hang her (hanger) in a cast like my arm itchin’!
We war different, but it’s the same old mission
I know the weight of a skull when the brains go missin’!
It ain’t all about gunplay when we claim my victim
‘Cause where I’m from, we like to play a game called “Get Him!”
(GET HIM!)
You old “Why Smack always play me to the back”-ass nigga! (GET HIM!)
You old “Beasley, they smokin’ in they room” ready to 
rat
-ass nigga! (GET HIM!)
You old “I’m not a racist - my sister’s boyfriend is Black”-ass nigga! (GET HIM!)
Well, I’ll kill 
YOU
, 
YO’ SISTER
 AND 
BLACK-ASS
, NIGGA! (GET HIM!)
We spark heaters!
I’m still in the ‘hood wit’ the raw diesel!
Everything you done in life, it was 
all legal
!
My guns think I don’t love ‘em no more, they all evil
Well, shout out Nina, Tre, and my Midget MAC
I can’t forget about the 
small people!
I’m like a barber when it come to these guns, I tape ‘em up
I put one against the grain: it ain’t a cut
This battle like a one-night stand: strange as (strangers) fuck!
Think Hernandez
‘Cause last time, Aaron caught a body, but this time, I’ll make him hang it up
I 
wish
 you asleep right now, I’ll wake him up
Bulldog under the pit: let’s make a mutt!
The knife poke him slow in the stomach: it’s makin’ love
That’s a Hawk (hug), and it’s back together: they makin’ up
I’m at his son birthday party like, “Nigga, say what’s up”
Gave lil’ man a Sig' (cig’), then blew the DJ like 
Player’s Club
Give me a sinus, open his chest like Vaporub
‘Cause this stick to his roof be makin’ the neighbors fussed!
Concrete, nigga

Yo, London, what’s up? What’s up, y’all?
It’s a good-ass crowd, y’all
I fuck wit’ y’all, man, I fuck wit’ y’all
Now...I don’t know if out in London, y’all say “Pause” or not
But we gon’ all agree it’s an awkward spot when Beasley calls you to 
offer Top
Nobody
 wanna take this plate! It gotta be force-fed
You say “No thanks”, you might wake up with a horse head in your bed!
I’ll take the battle, but I need more bread
Triple the digits, cop me 63 tickets
Fly out my mom, my kid, and my missus, then y’all can bring him to England
See what I did for my minion?
It’s me puttin’ T (tee) on like him when he’s swimmin’!
Ladies!
 Don’t we both look great?
Overweight, fried food fillin’ most our plates
Whatever diet we on gettin’ 3-0'd...no debate!
And I’m a handsome mu’fucka, but forget 
my
 groupies
More different colors of princess cut on him than 6ix9ine jewelry
I mean, the big guy’s boobies make women’s 
insides woozy
Just picturin’ (picture in) the head like a mid-flight movie!
Just look at him, right?
Picture the type of woman he’d wife…
BLECCH! No 
WAY
 you gettin’ pussy tonight!
Give your second half to any jezzie hooker you’d like
She might give you the 
box
, but she gon’ put up a 
fight!
But if we box, it’d be like as if we’d golf
‘Cause the very first time Iron swing, T (tee) 
off!
You’ll catch a beat down
One slap to T crown
He’ll be stumblin’ on stage like 
Smack between rounds!
Top terrified, see the fear inside his scary eyes
He’s wonderin’ where to hide
I’ll hunt & kill him and wear the hide
Or whatever Top thinkin’ he got, I could top that
Put the same bullet Lincoln got in Top hat!
This Michelin Man gettin' dunked-
Or I could do like you when you add cutter to the tan butter
Except when man choppin’ up grams, it’s your dad’s mother!
Then T-T-T gettin’ stuck like a bad stutter!
Then this Michelin Man gettin’ dunked in the back of a truck
A big round for T-Top head like an African ankh
Or I could bury him somewhere that no one gon’ see
In Homerton, B
Cause of death? 
Unknown-T!
WHAT’S UP!? WHAT’S UP!?
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOOD!?!
I’m the OG Creator, the bees and the birds
I’m on the best comeback since Jesus returned
That’s why I’m 
heated
 I ain’t get to eat the feast I deserve
But when they bring out the 
cracker
, you know 
T (tea) gettin’ SERVED!
You get these chances handed to you, wit’ your fans standin’ behind you
I earn mine by bein’ a man, standin’ on my two
NWX, whatever rap circle’s around him
Park Lyfe, Darkside - I’ll rap circles around ‘em
This ain’t Battle of the Night, it ain’t a challenge or a fight
This a 
flight
, and a trip to see the Palace with my wife
Book a champ like me for the talent and the hype
Book a chump like you just to balance out the price!
I’m the steak and potatoes, you the salad on the side
You can’t digest it, ‘cause you’ve never had a salad in your 
life!
Melvin, you’ve been sendin’ for me since you came out the house
With all of that “King, King…”
Bitch
, keep my name out your mouth!
What’s up!?

I said, yo
Did y’all know Jewish people circumcise their kids with they 
mouth?
Now that’s some 
nasty
 shit
I just booked this battle to say you’se a 
nasty
 bitch!
Now when his wife give him head, he say, “I remember when my dad did this”
Just the thought of yo’ family photos would have me 
sick!
And that ain’t it - all bullshit aside, Solomon
You lost to Math, but then Mook is where you died, Solomon
You ain’t even 
apologize
 for leavin’ SMACK
Now that’s mind-bogglin’
‘Cause you’ll put your son dick in your mouth, but now you got a problem 
pride
-swallowin’
See, you gotta respect the laws, or I’mma start disbarrin’ him
I’m the leader of the New School, it’s not for arguin’
He seen the fans’ Mount Rushmore, and it stopped his confidence
‘Cause the real legends never made a spot for Solomon!
I got a box for Solomon, a whole 
plot
 for Solomon
Sendin’ out head shots, and it’s not for modelin’
I’m lookin’ for the room that the doctor got him in
To break his nose bone ‘til the 
snot
 come out of it!
You not a snorter?
Well, try heroin, I got it fo’ ya
I’ll put a White boy on smack (SMACK) and shock The Culture
Have him front page of the paper: I’ll promote ya
Or die with a Sig’ (cig’) in your mouth: I’ll (Al) Capone ya!
I’m on ya! This ain’t gon’ go the way that you think, Aaron
Head shots, I’m hittin’ his yarmulke when that thing airin’
Take DNA belt off his shoulders and spank Aaron
Or put the .44 to his back: I’ll Hank Aaron!
Let’s rank Aaron, but dawg ain’t competin’ on the list
If it wasn’t for Organik, his career would be ceasin’ to exist
I could front you work, but if you plan on leavin’ with the bricks
I’ll use an arm over my paper like, “Ain’t nobody cheatin’ off my shit!”
Or I’ll beat him wit’ the blikk! Nigga, I got an iron piece
Somebody tell Iron “Please” ‘fore I give it to Iron niece
The irony’s he get a leg shot right through Iron knees
And now they 
both
 stuck together: look like they Siamese
Big cap! Leave him curled on the side like a Hasidic Jew
Or buck-fifty (*swoo*)
His face bubble up like acidic juice!
Big shark! You couldn’t survive in the kiddie pool!
They thought Iron bars could stop the Bear like a city zoo
Wait, I gotta work on performance
Lemme switch the groove
Got me snappin’ wit’ the arms out: this a Shiggy move!
He thinkin’ ‘cause he from New York, that nigga Biggie smooth
Well, if you ain’t married to Faith, then they’ll be missin’ you!
I hit the Jew
On the real, you had a chance to glow
We expected yo’ fans to grow
Some of us couldn’t stand you, tho’
But there you go, makin’ us sick, lettin’ yo’ tantrum show
Now I gotta ‘url (Earl) every time they sayin’ this man a GOAT (Manigault)
I would crack jokes about him havin’ one nut, but I ain’t know if he could handle those
And plus, everybody done said it, it’s like a damaged wrote
Damn it, bro!
I guess it’s somethin’ them niggas can’t let go
‘Cause after all this time, that one ball still gettin’ shade like LiAngelo
What’chu gon’ tell us, Iron?
One of the nurses did it?
It was a birth decision?
Or was Daddy goin’ too hard on that 
circumcision?
See, every time you mention that lil’ malfunction, he gets bothered
He gon’ rebuttal like, “Keep my nuts outta your mouth!”
You need to tell that to your 
father!
Aye, you better 
respect
 a real G!
‘Cause the 
Heckler’s
 still mean!
You can run if you want, I’mma let him build speed
Them Berettas will squeeze, I bet he’d feel these
I’ll put the toast to Iron like a ghetto grilled cheese!
Nigga, yo’ career will only take you as far as the gas go
You Premium, but it sound like ‘93 with that wack flow
I ain’t even bring a pump wit’ me to jack bro
We could tell by Aaron attire (airin’ a tire) he flat-broke
I ain’t even wanna face this square like the rag cold!
You fightin’ just to stay on this land like 
Smash Bros.
!
I don’t care if you was far away, or that close
I’mma find a way to fry some shit like Black folks!
Concrete, nigga

These comic authors who can’t find the right words to scribe
Make it a black-and-white issue like 
Spy vs. Spy
But we need every race in this room for our culture to function
And my contribution to it ain’t an open discussion
From my home where I come from, to gettin’ flown into London
It’s way past sport (passport) to me to keep upholdin’ these Customs!
In front of White crowds, I black out
With Black crowds, I light it up
You 
blind
 if you can’t see that, light or dark, I 
adjust
So brighten up
You couldn’t be as good as me in your dreams
All that “me being White” noise just gon’ put ‘em to sleep!
Like they swallowed an Ambien
I’m a God in this pantheon!
You got ‘em 
bored (boar’d) to death, King
: 
Robert Baratheon!
With coke lord stories that are more so folklore
Big man say the same thing every show: Hodor!
We get it! You cookin’ butter, feedin’ glass dick to your hooker mother
But you rappin’ ‘bout cuttin’ cookies so long that it’s cookie-cutter!
Like that bottom row of golden teeth?
Now that’s a style that no one’s seen…
I mean, aside from you, Shine, Roc, Math, Ill-
That’s 
so
 unique
Now every line that’s comin’ from this coward’s lips is counterfeit
And every time he smiles, we see somebody else’s style he 
bit!
See, Big Top’s content been like a carnival lately
More lyin’ (lion) in the ring with the Bear than Barnum & Bailey
With your bars, you a dealer, gram hustler, mass murderer
But in your videos, you be dressed like the Hamburglar!
In your song, you a Don, livin’ the lap of luxury
But you look like you never had a meal without plastic cutlery
You not a criminal mastermind, cookin’ pure snow
You might have had a couple of scraps (Skrapz) with 9s (Nines), but 
took the Church Road!
THE FUCK IS GOOD!?
See, my people sold E and coke, acid, ‘shrooms, and hustled sensi
Me and my dogs sold more buds than Spuds Mackenzie
Shit, when I was slingin’ trees, I even did deliveries
Bringin’ leaves by the O to your door like Christmas wreaths
See, the shit you think is 
power moves
, I could fuck 
around
 and do
It wasn’t smart to step up here: I had to 
dumb it down
 for you
A devil with the details, too technical to toy with
You keep writin’ trying to sharpen up your pencil, but it’s 
pointless
Been regrettin’ all his choices since the second that the coin flipped
I ain’t 
threatened
 by these 
trenches
 other 
legends
 have avoided!
SIDE BAR!
Volume 3 comin’! Aye Verb, stop runnin’!
Surf, how you take five shots and STILL DUCKIN’!?
Gotti not the champ! How could Geechi be above me?
I leave 
Earth
 every battle!
He can’t even leave 
the country!
(Fuck outta here!
2-0 already, and I’m 
not done!
 I’m 
not done!
)
(*Runs the scheme back for the crowd*)
Put the gas in the pedal, bring your pad and your pencil
Lemme exorcise (exercise) my demons: come and dance with the Devil!
Once the battles get settled, Smack, hand me the bread
I’ll drop every crumb in my path like Hansel and Gretel!
Back to you, Melvin…
So you the one who’s finna take down my crown?
With all of that “King, King…”
BITCH, keep my name out your mouth!

I said, London, this my closin’ verse!
Like, fuck a casket: throw this bastard in the back and just close the hearse!
I ain’t come here to make the crowd go berserk
I came here just to show y’all work…
(Now lemme 
PUT IT IN!
)
Now history says King Solomon was the smartest man that ever lived
But also one of the most foolish
Now that’s so true, it’s gotta be scary to go through it
I mean, we seen how you came in the game, so clueless
Dope music, but the way that you grinded was so stupid
For 
one second
, let’s take away that yo’ folks Jewish
And that you had every opportunity to blow, but y’all blew it
It’s all ruined
And he right: he 
is
 in here like a golf student
‘Cause now Iron tryna swing on T (tee) to 
get his ball movin’!
Nah, doofus! I’mma give you the 
truth!
Like if you want some back pay, you better get a masseuse!
JC started it, with the shit that he was diggin’ into
On how we Africans, but still the original Jews
And you knew it, too

Facts

Yeah, you knew it, too
This conversation is nothin’ private
We know when you put “-ish” on a word, that mean you somethin’ 
like it
So if I tell y’all I’m Black-
ish
, I’m undecided
You can’t sell a man a story who doesn’t buy it!
Y’all tried it, but it’s the logic I don’t agree wit’
Hitler might have been a monster, but he was 
genius
At least y’all niggas got reparations
We ain’t receive shit!
And now he wantin’ us to be proud of your achievement?
Well, if Holla don’t pop, his mama never get the treatment
If Roc weren’t hot, that nigga daughters won’t be eatin’
If I wasn’t Top, my auntie probably still be fiendin’!
You rap because you 
want
 it!
We rap because we 
need
 it!
You 
cheatin’
, ‘cause don’t you and your pops own a successful business in Manhattan?
(*Iron shakes his head “No”*)
Yes, you do
Now, I ain’t hatin’ you for that
I’ll let you be great...just be grateful where you at
Y’all conduct the marathons and all the races for the track
So you left battle rap and started 
chasin’
 you a bag
Commendable! Just remember how that plays into the fact
On why we clown you for them years that you wasted on your craft
Now he playin’ catch-up, ‘cause we replacin’ what he had
And the marathons remind him every day he gettin’ lapped!
In fact, lemme tell you the reasons why we get on you
‘Cause Hollow took his brand overseas and made tickets move!
John John and Ars’ league owners, gettin’ residuals
If he found out what 
Holla cost
 (Holocaust), he’d be the 
sickest
 Jew!
So Beasley started ditchin’ you, Poison Pen split on you
Sony got rid of you, told you they’re goin’ “digital”
Your career been like a handicap bathroom!
What, you don’t get it, dude?
You got 
bars inside
, but it’s mad room for us to 
shit on you!
I mean, you lyrical, but I paint pictures and make it visible
I tell stories 
beyond
 bars: I’m like the visit room
I mean, we seen his Mook interviews
Dude was lookin’ miserable
They gave him a lil’ space, then he changed, like a fitting room
I’d get confused - a Jewish man doin’ the Devil’s work?
Well, I’ll leave his features open like he lookin’ for a second verse
Berettas squirt, I’mma make it to where his head’ll burst
Or start smackin’ Iron like...like, “Man, this shit don’t 
never
 work!”
Bruh, don’t be alarmed
I’ll ride up soon as the beef is on
Drive-by, scope out the window like a peepin’ Tom
You’ll get the Swiss (Swizz), or the Pistol On My Side like the Weezy song!
Or learn how to watch what you say like a sing-along
Nigga! See, it’s a difference between Iron and me
This nigga Iron a 
geek
He went from Grind Time to SMACK, now he poppin’ the heat
But you are not from the streets
I don’t care how much y’all pay him
I’m not fakin’, not in the least
And that’s the difference…
This nigga Iron down to (the) front to make his pockets increase
You know, you 
iron down the front
 to make your pockets in-
I got a Louisville Slugger right now: bitch, I’m breaking dude
This bat’ll (battle) go back and forth: that ain’t debatable!
I’mma leave his dog wit’ the worms like table food!
His homies runnin’ after the bust (bus): they late for school!
Concrete, nigga

Yo, yo, y’all ready to bring it home?
So last year, your biggest loss was losin’ to Goodz’s inner thoughts
We saw you gettin’ taught what steppin’ to a vet in this ring could cost
And that Kenneka bar was 
light
 for him
His whole style’s a disgrace
Always talkin’ ‘bout pedophiles or someone’s child gettin’ raped
But 
you
 are the weird stranger
Not even a decent neighbor
Didn’t say shit to defend your Carolina 
streets
 (Streetz) from danger
Like your struggle bars on Funk Flex you 
struggled
 to remember
Top felt like Top’s belt...buckled under pressure!
See, the fans that you have who relate to yo’ life 
love
 you
You disrespect them when you treat this stage like a 
side hustle!
So 
FUCK
 your junkie mama and the problems in your community
If, when he gives you a way out, you 
squander the opportunity!
You ate the food that he fed to you
Drank the water he lead you to
Smack been hand-feedin’ this Bear like it’s a petting zoo!
And everybody is hungry, no one wants to eat slop
But when you hunt enough to feed your tummy, the greed 
stops!
You and Eric poured all that money in T pot (teapot)
Still, the Bear wanna milk you for honey that 
Beas’
 (bees) got!?
Like the company needs Top…
Imagine how Roc felt
Them couple of cheap shots...should’ve got Top shelved!
‘Cause Melvin...you’re the blueprint for a special sort of stupid
Recordin’ music that’s full of stories oozin’ wit’ your delusions
Sellin’ sniff the snorters usin’, wagin’ war on corners, shootin’
But never got caught or wounded like some sort of immortal mutant
This street legend who formed a union
With battle rappers, a supportive movement
Just to help him have a conversation ‘bout business wit’ a normal human
Boss, what part of you bein’ a conglomerate leader is that?
You use cocaine as a 
crutch
You couldn’t lean on his 
staff?
In retrospect, was “Smack, I would like an extra check”
The words that you were too much of a 
coward
 to have said direct?
Gonna write an email? Send a text?
Just when we thought we couldn’t have less respect…
Airin’ family business out in public like Cadet and Krept!
OH, no! But in battle rap, that’s how family man do!
I get mad at my son, I’ll run to AngryFan, too
And skip the scholars and entrepreneurs, forget the college
You can get all of your business knowledge just by callin’ up Hitman Holla
Y’all just let bygones be bygones, when you got what you had your eye on!
I thought that formin’ a 
union
 meant puttin’ 
you and I on (U-N-I-ON)!
But you’re 
selfish
...you’re 
selfish
...
‘Til a couple extra digits, them threats were finished!
Yes man, went from “we” (oui) to “I” (aye), like switchin’ from French to English!
It’s different! 
Super
 different!
Now it’s another year with this 
dummy
 here, with Smack as the puppeteer
And all the moves you make have strings attached ‘cause you’re a 
puppet-tier
Your hands are tied, they get to tell you when, who, what, and where
And if there’s a clothing sponsorship, too, they tell you 
what to wear!
Son, let’s get somethin’ clear:
I’ve been up in here for 20 years
Was doin’ this when there was 
no
 money, ‘cause nobody cared!
Your little young career is nothin’ near what it takes to make you my fuckin’ peer, you fat little 
gummy Bear!
So yeah, sometimes the game is suspect
Ask me ‘bout it: I’ll change the subject
‘Cause business is just business, and real mean don’t complain in public!
Melvin, the fuck you gotta say ‘bout it now?
“King, King…”
BITCH, keep my name out your mouth!
That’s a classic, bro! That’s a classic!
Can we be friends again?
