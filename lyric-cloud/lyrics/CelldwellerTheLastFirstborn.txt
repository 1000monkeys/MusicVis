Oh, man, I can't believe that you did what they said you did
And to this day I've still gotta say that in my mind I question it
I wish I knew what you had meant before you went
And left me wondering to just an echo of your voice
(Listen)
(Listen)
(Listen)
(Listen)

Now I wait to take my turn to bleed like a kid playing with a razor blade
And wonder if I have the balls at all or if I'm gonna be afraid
Where are you? What do you think? 'Cause I'm not sure when knocking at Death's door
If I will be welcomed in or be left alone outside

(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)
(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)

I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark (Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down (Firstborn, last one)
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline (Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me (Firstborn, last one)

I guess there comes a point when you think to yourself
"This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"
And now I feel what you felt, and now I feel what you felt inside, brother
And now I feel what you felt: "This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"
(Listen)
(My son)
(Firstborn, last one)

(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)
(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)

I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark (Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down (Firstborn, last one)
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline (Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me (Firstborn, last one)
(Listen)

I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't end this way
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't
I wish it didn't end this way

Live a life in hell through a mortal shell, asphyxiating smell
For a crime, lifetime, imagination locked in a cell
And to the other firstborn I see the same scene that must play over in your mind
And now how much more I'm sure it's fucked with your head just like it's fucked up mine

Listen
My son
Firstborn
Last one
The message you sent out to me
I cannot change what's meant to be
The message you sent out to me
I cannot change what's meant to be
(What am I supposed to do now?)

(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)

I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark
I see the darkness surround the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline (Listen)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me (My son)
I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark (Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down (Firstborn, last one)
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline (Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me (Firstborn, last one)
(Firstborn)
You are the last one (Firstborn)
