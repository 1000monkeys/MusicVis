What do you take me for?
I will never be an open door
I'm the threat in your dreams
The trick up your sleeves
I'm the clod in your veins
What do you blame me for?
We were never seeing soul to soul
I'm the drag in your feet
The guilt that you plead
I'm the wear in your brakes

Then how do we get

Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
And now we're on like a thunder

What are you aiming for?
I will never be the one to call
When your heart is in need
The coward in me
Will be all that you face
Why do you say no more?
Was the heaven that I sold you on
Just a trifling daze?
A glorious cage?
And it all was in vain?

Then how do we get

Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
And now we're on like a thunder

I deleted
All that I am
Seems to be dead
Don't you waste it
I deleted
All that I am
Seems to be dead
Don't you waste it

Then how do we get away?
Then how do we get

Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
Then how will we get away?
Stone cold, red hot and
And now we're on like a thunder
Soon all ends go dead
And now we're on like a thunder
