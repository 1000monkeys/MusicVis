Fuck the rules
I've got nothing to lose
Call me a fool
But I've got nothing to prove

If life's an ocean, I'm in the deep end
Swimming free from the fears that will drown me
Don't try to catch me if I jump in
And don't try to fix what's not broken

I won't stop, I'm gonna live forever
Burn it all, like nothing ever mattered
One thrill and it takes me higher
Dancing in a ring of fire
Shut my eyes, I know it's now or never
Ride or die, I let my heart surrender
Rise up, I was born a fighter
Dancing in a ring of fire
Dancing in a ring of fire
Dancing in a ring of fire
Dancing in a ring of fire
Dancing in a ring of fire
Ring of fire
Dancing in a ring of fire

Fuck the world
I don't need to be cured
I'll keep my word
I'm gonna walk where the line's blurred

If life's an ocean, I'm in the deep end
Swimming free from the fears that will drown me
Don't try to catch me if I jump in
And don't try to fix what's not broken

I won't stop, I'm gonna live forever
Burn it all, like nothing ever mattered
One thrill and it takes me higher
Dancing in a ring of fire
Shut my eyes, I know it's now or never
Ride or die, I let my heart surrender
Rise up, I was born a fighter
Dancing in a ring of fire
Dancing in a ring of fire
