This body is not my body
When I am drunk and out of mind
This bottle thinks that it owns me
But it can't own me if I am dead

I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that

This body is not my body
When all these creatures eat my skin
They're searching for bits of my soul
For bits of my soul that are left

I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that D-D-DWI
I got the fuck my life, DWI
I got that

I got that
I got that
I got that
