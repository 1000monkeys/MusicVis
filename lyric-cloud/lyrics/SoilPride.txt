When you scream aloud (heads down, heads down)
That's when I plan to (rise up, rise up)
When you scream aloud (we're doomed, we're doomed)
That's when I plan to prove myself to you
I've never gotten the simple thrill of a solo day
I've never seen the point in you killing you
I've always backed my words with what I do
I'll always bite my tongue to comfort you
I'll be my superhero number one
I'll save me from myself
I, I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride
Sister, you know me (sister, you know me)
Mother, you made me
Lover, what do you offer me?
Father, teach me, brother, protect
Lover, what do you have for me?
I'll be my superhero number one
I'll save me from myself
I'll be your superhero number one
I'll save you, I'll save
I, I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride
I'll save you
I'll save you
I'll save you
Your eyes
Deny
A life that dulls your pride
Your eyes
They hide
Through me, you'll heal in time
When you scream aloud (heads down, heads down)
That's when I plan to (rise up, rise up)
When you scream aloud (we're doomed, we're doomed)
That's when I plan to prove myself to you
I'll be my superhero number one
I'll save me from myself
I'll be your superhero number one
I'll save you, I'll save
I, I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride
I'll be your superhero number one
I'll save your from yourself
I'll be my superhero number one
I'll save me, my pride
