Songtekst van Kensington – "Chronos Pt. 1"

I’m told that I should not have seen it
I know that I could not obey
Demons line up to fade out our colours
All around
There's not a fire that we're not feeding
There's not a bribe that we don't take

Leave it undone and take out our mother
In her own home

Seen from miles away
No one moved
How did we lead it this far when we knew it was dead from the start?
How can we still disregard when we know that we tore it apart?

Now the lions are defeated
Now the tyrants are embraced
Demons line up and waves are uncovered
And it is all done

Seen from miles away
No one moved
How did we lead it this far when we knew it was dead from the start?
How can we still disregard when we know that we tore it apart?
How did we lead it this far when we knew it was dead from the start?
If all we can feed on is bred within greed then I'd rather I starve
