EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
GANDALF!
VS!
DUMBLEDORE!
BEGIN!

You shall not pass! I rap fast like Shadowfax
Tom Riddle me this you bitch, how’s your little wand going to beat my staff?
I leave mics in flames torched by Gandalf
Touch mine, Dumbledore and scorch your other hand off
You fool, you got Snaped, You’re not a real fighter
Death makes you die, it just make my brights brighter
You ass is like Gringotts, everyone makes a deposit
We all know you’ve more than a boggart in your closet

The prophecy forgot to mention this day
When I knocked your ass back to Gandalf the Grey
Check your status they call me headmaster, you’re nothing
Nice staff, you compensating for something?
I prefer the company of wizards and I’m proud of it
You try to win your battles with two fat hobbits
You think your hairy toed friends are gonna harm me?
Wait until they get a taste of Dumbledore’s Army

Do not take me for some conjuror of cheap tricks
I don’t give a Fawkes about your Order of Phoenix
I’ll tie a new knot in your beard with your wrinkly balls
For I am the one rapper to rule them all

Your spells are a joke, not funny ones either
Mines of Moria? Ha! More like Mind of Mencia
I’ll expecto my patronum on your face you little snitch
And when I’m finished, I'mma fly like it's quidditch
WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EEE
EEE
EEE
