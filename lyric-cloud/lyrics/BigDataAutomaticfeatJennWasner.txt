I feel so much better today
Now that you're mine
Couldn't do it alone
And I never will again

You're my eyes, my feet and my hands
The thoughts in my mind
I don't even have to try
You make me better than I am
Than I am
So much better than I

Automatic
I give up, give up
Here I am, don't you want me to do it again
(It's automatic, it's automatic)
Here I am, 'cause you need me to do it again
(It's automatic, it's automatic)

I feel so much lighter today
(Now that there's time)
Can't remember my name
But you can tell me who I am

There's no shame in making it easy
(When it's not easy)
I don't even have to try
You do it better than I can
Than I can
So much better than I

Automatic
I give up, give up
Here I am, don't you want me to do it again
(It's automatic, it's automatic)
Here I am, 'cause you need me to do it again
(It's automatic, it's automatic)
(All let go)
I'm ready
(I know)
If you let me
(Take control)
Just forget it, it's so automatic

I'll be the one to make your heart beat right
Walk you in circles, I'll speak your mind
I'll breathe your air to make you feel alive
I'll be your feeling, your skin and bones
Pay your attention, be your house and home
I'll keep your company, you'll never be alone

Automatic
I give up, give up
Here I am, don't you want me to do it again
(It's automatic, it's automatic)
Here I am, 'cause you need me to do it again
(It's automatic, it's automatic)
(All let go)
I'm ready
(I know)
If you let me
(Take control)
Just forget it, it's so automatic

I feel so much better today
Now that you're mine
