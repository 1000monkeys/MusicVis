Did you get what you need
Let me know before you leave
Did you get what you came for?
There's a world at your feet
When you're standing next to me
Did you get what you came for?
If it ain't enough
Shake the world right up
If it ain't enough
You can take my love
Did you get what you need
Let me know before you leave
Did you get what you came for?
There's a world at your feet
When you're standing next to me
Did you get what you came for?
Shake the world right up
You can take my love
Shake the world right up
You can take my love
Did you get what you need
Let me know before you leave
Did you get what you came for?
There's a world at your feet
When you're standing next to me
Did you get what you came for
If it ain't enough
Shake the world right up
If it ain't enough
You can take my love
Did you get what you need
Let me know before you leave
Did you get what you came for?
There's a world at your feet
When you're standing next to me
Did you get what you came for? (get what you came for)
Did you get what you need
Let me know before you leave
Did you get what you came for
There's a world at you feet
When you're standing next to me
Did you get what you came for? (get what you came for)
Shake the world right up
You can take my love
Shake the world right up
You can take my love
