The devil will be free
You cannot run for me
The devil we will be
So come on home to me
The devil will be free
You cannot run for me
The devil we will be
So come on home to me

This feeling that I feel is unreal
(Come on home to me)
This feeling that I feel is unreal
This feeling that I feel is unreal
(So come on home to me)
This feeling that I feel is unreal

The devil will be free
You cannot run for me
The devil we will be
So come on home to me

This feeling that I feel is unreal
(Come on home to me)
This feeling that I feel is unreal
This feeling that I feel is unreal
(So come on home to me)
This feeling that I feel is unreal
