Don't fight it, girl
Just give it time, and some kind of chance to grow
We're onto something beautiful, oh oh
Don't fight it, girl
Just give it time, and some kind of chance to grow
Cause we're onto something beautiful, oh oh

I'll fight it, boy
You don't understand how the world works
You like me now, but later you'll move
I'll fight it, boy
Don't have the time or luxury to let my guard down
Boy, I'm onto something genius
Look into my eyes
Don't see no sunsets, my soul is charcoaled
Well, the thoughts are, baby, all that you see
Can't tell you, boy
Don't let this pale skin fool you, I'm a dark soul
And I think I got it figured all out

Checking for the love
Checking for the love
Checking for the love
Checking for the love
Checking for the love
Checking for the love
Checking for the love
Checking for the love

Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it
Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it
Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it
Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it

Checking for the love
Don't fight it, girl
Checking for the love
Just give it time and some kind of chance to grow
Checking for the love
We're onto something beautiful, oh oh
Checking for the love
Don't fight it, girl
Checking for the love
Just give it time and some kind of chance to grow
Checking for the love
Cause we're onto something beautiful, oh oh
