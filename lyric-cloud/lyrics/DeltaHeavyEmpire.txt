Time brings all things to pass
There are no second chances
There's only this moment, and the next
Where everything you want will collide
With everything standing in your way
Purpose and meaning are not to be found in the laws of nature
It is our job to create them
As we journey into the vast emptiness of the universe
And seek fellowship among the stars
We are the architects of the future
This is our empire
This is our empire
This is our empire
