Seems like a long walk home and I canâ€™t imagine why
We're having strange talks and not even angels can break to life
And I don't know what is felt down by this line
And it's difficult
It's so difficult

I don't know what it takes to know myself
And you don't know me better than anybody else
I'm running round in circles as no way out
But I can make this hurt and I don't need your help

Seems like a long time since I've looked into your eyes and now looking back
Am I really the enemy if I'm getting defensive when you want to talk
And I need to forget, about everything and more
About everything and more

I don't know what it takes to know myself
And you don't know me better than anybody else
I'm running round in circles as no way out
But I can make this hurt and I don't need your help
