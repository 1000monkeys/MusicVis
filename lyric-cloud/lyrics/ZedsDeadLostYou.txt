I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if i lost you
 (you, you, you, you)

 (you, you)

It's the sickest kinda feeling I got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out and you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free
