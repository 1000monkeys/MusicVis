Quite surprised
Just one look into your eyes
Can change my mind
Then again, I don't mind
I seem to find
All the answers to the questions I don't like
But you make them all alright

Yeah, I often wonder what really it is that you offer me
At least I feel your touch, even if it's just when you walk on me
Your mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of me
I want to feel your depth, but your heart is deaf when you talk to me
I guess that's what we were taught
We open up dependin' on how many drinks we have bought
He wants your head and it's ironic, doesn't care 'bout your thoughts
You're one more drink away from drowning, feeling empty and lost
But me, I'm no better, she wants to fuck around and I let her
A culture now of "we're together," but was never together​
I know you're lookin' for one-night, and I've been stuck on forevers
I think it's sad that I'm naive to think that we could do better, but fuck it
​I should've known from the start
And even after all this time, I still don't know who you are
​There's more to life than likes and hoppin' bars, and gettin' high inside your car
You're feelin' distant, feeling far, your wall is up, I know it's hard, and so

Tell me somethin' only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart, if I have yours, then let me know
And tell me somethin' only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know?
If you love me, let me know
Let me know
Let me know

I often wonder what really it is that I offer you
At least you feel my touch, even if it's just when I walk on you
My mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of you
You want to feel my depth, but my heart is deaf when I talk to you
A viscous game that we play
See, nowadays, they say love and hate are one and the same
​You let me beat around the bush until you're sick of my games​
​It's never fair because you care and I just transfer the blame
I transfer my pain, a shame to know that you could do better
​How selfish, is it my concern as if I'm makin' you wetter
How selfish, is it you just want me 'cause I make you feel better
And we just chop it up to bein' drunk, there's wine on your sweater
Alone, but together, we always make it less than it seems
It's funny how if you have feelin's, you're weak, so we say less than we mean
You hate waitin', we're not datin' and not vocal
We're game-playin', I hate sayin', but still hopeful
I'm conflicted, I'm lost in a lot of women
I know our situation's been sticky since the beginnin'
She left me out in limbo, you deal with my indecision
Don't know if you'll ever love me or love the talent I'm given, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
How can I feel so fuckin' lonely with your hands on my heart?
Your hands on my chest, you whisper, "What do you want to do next?"
Our generation's taken love out of sex
, and so the question is left

Tell me somethin' only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart, if I have yours, then let me know
And tell me somethin' only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know?
If you love me, let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Ooh, let me know
(Know, let me know, let me know)
