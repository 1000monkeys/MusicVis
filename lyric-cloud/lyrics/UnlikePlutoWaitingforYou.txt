You've been far away
What have you got to say?
My heart is on display
But I'm not afraid
Yeah, I'm not afraid

While you've been getting busy
I've been getting dizzy
Trying not to keep you in mind
And now I enjoy devising
Suddenly enticing
Since you came back in my life

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Do what you gotta do
Yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do
Yeah, I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you


You left without a line
Was it by design?
If what you want is time
Don't go wastin' mine
Don't be wastin' mine

Well, it's starting to get hold
I'm not tryin' to be cold
I just think it's time that you see
Now, I can't wait forever
Yes, it's now or never
Walk on you to get with me

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Do what you gotta do
Yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do
Yeah, I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you


(Oooh, wooo)
(Hehehahaha)

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Ooh, yeah
I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you


(Hehehahaha)
