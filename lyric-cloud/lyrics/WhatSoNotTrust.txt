And if you caught my eye, I would act surprised
Cause we could watch this love, from the sidelines
Or we could take a chance, and at least we'd tried

It's hard for me to trust you
When all I see, is your hand and mouth
And all I need is for you, to trust me
Come closer, come closer, I need you here right by my side

It's hard for me

Then you'd wake me up, when it's over
When I'm in too deep, and I've lost my mind

It's hard for me to trust you
When all I see, is your hand and mouth
And all I need is for you, to trust me
Come closer, come closer, I need you here right by my side

It's hard for me to
It's hard for me to trust you
It's hard for me
It's hard for me, and all I need, all I need, all I need to trust you
It's hard for
