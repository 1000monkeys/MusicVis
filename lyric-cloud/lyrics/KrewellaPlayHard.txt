I can play...

I can play hard
Catch me at the bar
You're fuckin' with a star
Cause I can play hard
Hard...
I can play hard
Whiskey and cigars
You're watchin' from afar
How I can play hard

I can play... (hard)
I can play... (hard)

Burning holes in the back of my head
Hanging on to every word that I said
Got your heart in the palm of my hand
(In the palm of my hand)

I can play hard
Catch me at the bar
You're fuckin' with a star
Cause I can play hard
Hard...
I can play hard
Whiskey and cigars
You're watchin' from afar
How I can play hard

I'm in the...
I'm in the spotlight

On your knees, got you holding your breath
Demons out, but you're better off dead
Bottled up, get it off my chest
(Get it off my chest)

I can play hard
Catch me at the bar
You're fuckin' with a star
Cause I can play hard
Hard...
I can play hard
Whiskey and cigars
You're watchin' from afar
How I can play hard

I can play...
