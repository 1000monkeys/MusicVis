(Close your eyes)
(The wave is just about to break)

When the lightning bolt strikes on a clear blue sky I'm chillin
When the good times roll at the speed of light I'm chillin
When they cramping my style with a dollar sign I'm chillin
When I'm jonezin for you in the waiting line I'm chillin

I'm feeling love, I feel alive
Don't care how, don't know why
I feel the wave building up
I'm chillin
Now tell me do you feel that rush

Feels good to be high, high
Feels good to be alive, alive
Feels good to be high, high
Feels good to be alive, alive

Wish you could be high for the rest of your life you'll be chillin
Your body want that rush but Ima give it time I'll be chillin
Cause we'll be ridin that vibe til the day we die we'll be chillin
Until our heart goes flat on the thin red line we'll be chillin

I’m feeling love, i feel alive
(ease off the pressure)
Don’t care how, don’t know why
I feel the wave building up
(ease off the pressure)
And i’m chillin

Ooh, the slow motion of it
Caught up in the ocean of it
The pressure to be perfect, perfect
(Doesn't matter if it doesn't make my heart go)
Close your eyes
The wave is just about to break
Embrace the unknown
Soaring through space
Completely weightless
Completely free
Close your eyes
The wave is just about to break
