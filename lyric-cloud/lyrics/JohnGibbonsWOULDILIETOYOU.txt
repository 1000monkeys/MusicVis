Nothing but love, baby, hm
(Hoo, look into my eyes)
(Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah c'mon
Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it's open, I can't do no more
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh-oh)
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?) c'mon
Everybody's got their history (History)
On every page a mystery (It's a mystery, yeah)
You can read my diary, you're in every line
Jealous minds, never satisfied
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (In this heart of mine)
