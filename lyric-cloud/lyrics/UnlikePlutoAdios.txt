So adios to the girl I knew
Sayonara to the life you screwed
Bon voyage, put the car in cruise
Pick a fuckin' language
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you

The tug-a-war between you and me
I pull you in but the rope broke free
Electrostatic love, no clarity
We repel like two opposing enemies, yeah
You and I, will go to waste
You and I, will go to waste-eh
Your crazy I, don't want to stay
Your crazy I, don't want to stay-eh
I'm bidding you adieu today, yeah
That’s it, I'm done, until the end

So adios to the girl I knew
Sayonara to the life you screwed
Bon voyage, put the car in cruise
Pick a fuckin' language

Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you

Twenty-three we said our lives would elevate
That didn’t mean that I would give you everything
You wanted me to fit the image in your head
But your take on life is through a blurry lens, yeah
The lost time, it went away
The lost time, it ticked away
A new life, seize the day
A new life, I’m gonna chase
Laissez-faire from today, yeah
Goodbye, salud! I’m through

So adios to the girl I knew
Sayonara to the life you screwed
Bon voyage, put the car in cruise
Pick a fuckin' language

Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you

You can show your love in many ways but there is
Only one way to say goodbye
No one's ever perfect, I thought you were worth it
Au revoir, for the very last time
I’ll runaway
I’ll runaway

So adios to the girl I knew
Sayonara to the life you screwed
Bon voyage, put the car in cruise
Pick a fuckin' language

Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
Finally I'm done with you
