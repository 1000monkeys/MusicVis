Prophecy of Ragnarök
Twilight of the Gods
No escaping destiny when Baldur’s gone
Snow and ice will freeze the world
Mountains crack
Fenrir’s fetters is no more
The sky is turning black
Prophecy of Ragnarök
Legend of our death
Time to be corroded by the serpent’s breath
Riding through the wastelands
There is fire everywhere
The gods won’t be around to hear our final prayer
(Axe time, sword time)
Gods go under
(Wind time, wolf time)
Death to all
(Axe time, sword time)
Shields are sundered
(Wind time, wolf time)
Worlds will fall
Titans of justice
Fearless we stand
Odin All-Father are we blessed by your hand
Together we rise
Together we fight
We ride into battle and into the night
The giants are raging
The gods meet their fate
The heavens crack open
Thunder fall through the land
Guardian of Bifrost is blowing his horn
We ride into battle and into the storm
Brothers they be fighting
Together side by side
Valkyries assembling
As Aegir brings the tide
In Odin’s Hall we gather champions from the past
Warriors of Valhalla we will die at last
Everything’s devoured by the rushing of waves
The bottom of the ocean will be our graves
Mountains clash together under Yggdrasil
Crumbling to pieces and sink into the sea
(Axe time, sword time)
Gods go under
(Wind time, wolf time)
Death to all
(Axe time, sword time)
Shields are sundered
(Wind time, wolf time)
Worlds will fall
Titans of justice
Fearless we stand
Odin All-Father are we blessed by your hand
Together we rise
Together we fight
We ride into battle and into the night
The giants are raging
The gods meet their fate
The heavens crack open
Thunder fall through the land
Guardian of Bifrost is blowing his horn
We ride into battle and into the storm
A perfect darkness follows all
A perfect silence to end the war
Oh, Ginnungagap, oh bottomless abyss
It’s the ultimate nothingness where death is bliss
(Axe time, sword time)
Warriors of Valhalla
(Wind time, wolf time)
Hear my final words
(Axe time, sword time)
This is our purpose
(Wind time, wolf time)
This is our end
(Axe time, sword time)
(Wind time, wolf time)
(Axe time, sword time)
(Wind time, wolf time)
Worlds will fall!
