My life is complicated
I tried but it's too late and
Just when I think that it's OK
This place has overtaken
More and more than I'm here
It's all fake, I can't tell
I think I finally understand
How I got this way
Every day I think that I'm jaded
More than I can admit
In every way I think that I'm jaded, jaded
To all that I have hated
I can't begin to state that
In every way that I think
My brain's activated
More and more than I'm here
It's all fake, I can't tell
I think I finally understand
How I got this way
Every day I think that I'm jaded
More than I can admit
In every way I think that I'm jaded, jaded
I'm jaded
There is no way 'I can turn back
I see all things and it's crystal clear, it's clear
Living here is war on my life
It has changed every piece of me
Every day I think that I'm jaded
More than I can admit
In every way I think that I'm jaded, jaded
