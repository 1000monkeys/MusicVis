Take my money
[Verse 1: Luke & 
Michael
]
Black jeans, white tee, black Converse
You know she gets it right
Blue hair, blue eyes, I saw her
I couldn't help it, I was like
"I wanna be, be, be in the game
I wanna know, know your middle name
If we can go, go, it won't be the same
'Cause right now you're killing the game"

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Take my money
[Verse 2: Calum & 
Ashton
]
Late night, passed out in Tokyo
New York, LA, Chicago
She said her friends would like the show
Backstage, we'll let them in
"They wanna be, be, be in the game
They wanna know, know what we've gotta say
And in the front row, you're going insane
And in the back row you're killing the game"

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like


Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place, you can all
Take my money, take my keys
Drive this car through the drive-thru please
From the floor to the ceiling, robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place catch that feeling like
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Take my money
Take my money
