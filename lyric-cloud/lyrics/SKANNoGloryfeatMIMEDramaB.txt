Found a little bit of light, tryna find my heart
Funny when I'm bright, gotta lifestyle dark
Honey when I write, get a tight flow spark
With a psycho chart, playing dice go start
Oh who are you, better know yourself
Know your soul gotta know your wealth
Slow your role, getta a hold don't melt
And don't you fall, when it feel like hell

Oh who am I, M.I.M.E I'm not the one you wanna fuck with
Late nights messin' up my sleep so I'm flustered
Taking out aggression with my pen because I trust it
Writin' tryna get myself a Lamb colored custard

For the game
Leave 'em hanging by his chain
Click bang, feel enraged
Feel it firin' my brain. Feel insane
Enda story, feel the flame
45 to my brain, praying "lord please help"
No Glory


No glory, I, M.I.M.E I'm not the one you wanna fuck with
Late nights messin' up my sleep so I'm flustered
Taking out aggression with my pen because I trust it
Writin' tryna get myself a Lamb colored custard

No glory

Remember, I used to be that kid that everyday would get rejected Y'all got my story the glory was painted on a song
I'm mortified but feel immortal
This pen to this paper always open up different portals
It's I and me, it's me and I'm by myself I'm down to ride
I'm taking on the tides, size of tsunamis touchin' the sky
I get a quick scan , it's time to move
Leavin' everything else behind, I got something to prove

I'm just running away
No, I ain't running away
I got memories saved oh I'm just findin' my place
Where I belong to
Barely glory in my soul
Eyy I'm riding away yeah, I'm findin' my place yeah
I gotta escape yeah, it's what I gotta do
See you on the other side
See you on the other side
See you on the other side
We all know

No I ain't running running running yeah
I'm coming coming coming yeah
Knocking all these demons that been tryna run up on me yeah
Oh I keep on fighting, they keep coming coming coming yeah
I'ma keep keep on fighting till I'm gone
I need the glory
