Disturbing the peace, swerving in suburbans from beef
Cops lurking, still searching for murdering beats
I heard that you sweet, niggas look like girls when you speak. Crying all the time cause I'm around the world with my heat
The urban thief
You heard that we deep? Nigga we like birds in the tree
Dirty my trees for scuffing in church with the priest
Pharaoh clique cracks the rebirth of MCs
First to squeeze, stomp you on your turf if I please
Mercy me, understand the words I teach
The verse is complete and really what are you worth to me, Dinosaur Ds fitteds with the purplest
You in the big leagues dawg so you better get more raps
Label more shiesty and they hit you with more stress
This rap shit got fam thinking we more black
Freedom from our contracts, album with more cheques
I watched a lot of big-mouth rappers get jigged up
Now we at the round table holding our drinks up, our backstage tour blowing that stink up
As little kids we was all singing
Now with my family drinking under canopies
Reef, A-O, a glimpse on thug fantasy
A fireplace, white-gold mantel under out Grammy beats
The definition of nice, it took me a little time
I talked to the mic, you scream at it like Lil' John
These DVD video shoots lying about
When niggas out here is spitting is true
These little niggas claustrophobic scared to get in the booth
What you is spitting is funny, I'm McScrooge, I be swimming in money
