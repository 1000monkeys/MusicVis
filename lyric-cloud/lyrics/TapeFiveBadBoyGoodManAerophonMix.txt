Ready 1-2-3
I'm a bad boy
The ballrooms packed with cokey girls
Satin frocks and shining pearls
Click my fingers ladies swoon
The hottest dancer in the room
I'm a bad boy – I need to dance
If you don't dance no romance
Feel like dancing dance with me
First dance is always free
I'm a bad boy
Bebop sliding down my back
Never alone when I hit the sack
Swings a thing with a ringa-ding-ding
I get wings when I sing —
Ragtime reason and rhyme
I'm the reason, you're divine
Rhumba mambo latin samba
I'm a bad boy – I need to dance
If I don't dance no romance
Feel like dancing dance with me
First dance is always free
I'm a bad boy
Bad boy – I need to dance
If I don't dance no romance
Feel like dancing dance with me
I'm a bad boy – I need to dance
If I don't dance no romance
Feel like dancing dance with me
First dance is always free
