Yeah
Yeah, it's a champion mindset you’re getting me
Yeah they say, you win some, you lose some
But you live, you live to fight another day
See, they might have you down one day
But tomorrow, I'm indestructible
Listen man, I've been beat down before
I’ve been chewed up, I've been spit out
But I never gave up on myself
I kept telling myself: life's a bitch sometimes
You just gotta be a man and keep fighting
So I did, I fought
And you know what they say: repetition is the father of learning
Every day I got stronger, I got bigger, hungrier
It's that champion mindset
You know, indestructible
Yeah, indestructible
Man, you're not alone
Whatever outside forces we have to deal with, we will
It's us against them
We're strong, we're big
We’re indestructible
