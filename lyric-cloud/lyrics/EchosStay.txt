I wish you'd float above me
Wrap your arms around me
Let your love unfold
Show up in my city
Don't tell nobody
That you're feeling cold

And it's so good to be
Good to be yours
And I've got everything
That you'd ever want
Oh, it's so good to be
Good to be yours
But I'm so terrified
You'll leave me in the dark

Oh, stay
Stay
Stay
Stay

I lose myself in your eyes
Press your hands against mine
Tell me what you know
Share your secrets with me
I won't tell nobody
That you're feeling cold

And it's so good to be
Good to be yours
And I've got everything
That you'd ever want
Oh, it's so good to be
Good to be yours
But I'm so terrified
You'll leave me in the dark

Oh, stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
