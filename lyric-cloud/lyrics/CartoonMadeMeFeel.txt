Brought you to the station
Couldn't hold you back
Feeling trains in motion
Pushed me back to black
Waiting on the phone you left me all alone
Alone, alone

And I know I should've mentioned how my
Heart and my contention for the right to be
The stronger one
The smarter one
But it wouldn't even matter
Cause between us things were scattered
And the stitches would've hurt no matter
What we did, what we did

It doesn't even matter how much you mean to me
The only thing that matters is how you made me feel
