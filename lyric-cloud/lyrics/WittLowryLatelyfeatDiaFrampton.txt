Yeah

Lately, I been reminded, they say that time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, 
I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I could write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure of your worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty-thousand strings
Holding back our past precaution, not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me then? I get it, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, 
in case we lose it
, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think

Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

Lately, I been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring your wall down, I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind wander when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringin' me closer in love with lovin' what can be
I know

Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love is apparent
You're self-conscious of your ears, your hair's always down when you wear it
And you know I never drink when I'm Saké drunk, it's apparent
I know, I just love watching you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a temp, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know…

Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
