Why am I lonely?
Why am I lonely when you're here?
Right there beside me
Touching and holding but I don't feel anything that's real inside myself
Baby, death is at the door
Push and shove, come on, give me something
What are we here for?

Who can save us?
Who can save us?
Who, jumpstart this heart of ours before it's torn apart
Who can save us?

Finally found you
Finally found what I thought I wanted
Was it about you?
Or was I hiding from a fear of never knowing love would come to me
Baby, just a lonely soul
Running out of rose-colored glasses
Should I just let go?

Who can save us?
Who can save us?
Who, jumpstart this heart of ours before it's torn apart
Who can save us?

Who can save us?
Who can save us?
Who, jumpstart this heart of ours before it's torn apart
Who can save us?
