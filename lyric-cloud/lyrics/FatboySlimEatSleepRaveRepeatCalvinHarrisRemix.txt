So there was this DJ who was like kicking off
I don't know what he was doing
But it was sick man
Like, he was like
Hands in the air
And then this cat walked in
You know, not like a cat
Like a feline cat
Like a real, like you know
Like
You know what I'm saying dog
Like cats and dogs
It was raining
It wasn't raining
We were raving
And I don't know whether he was really saying it
All he kept saying was
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x4)
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)

Suddenly I think I'm on the phone
Suddenly I think I'm telling a story
But I'm not
I'm just dancing
I'm just dancing
I'm just sleeping
I'm just raving
I'm just repeating
And on (x4)

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)


Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat (x8)
