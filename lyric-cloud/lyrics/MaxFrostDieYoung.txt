So you wanna die young
Another legendary face
Another honorary star
The world will celebrate for days
So you wanna die young
Each little girl will know your name
Like it was written on their hearts
And it could never be erased

Every night you're terrified
Of what you won't become
Ooh, so you wanna die young
Ooh

So you wanna die young
Turn the night into the day
Drink it in before it's gone
Like it's trying to get away
So you run and you run
From a thing you can't escape
You can hear it catching up
And it's whispering your name

Every night you're terrified
Of what you won't become
Ooh, so you wanna die young
Ooh (so you wanna die y-)

(From the sound, from the sound)
So you run and you run
(From the sound, from the sound)
So you run and you run
(From the sound, from the sound)
So you run and you run
(From the sound, from the sound)

Every night you're terrified
Of what you won't become
Ooh, so you wanna die young
Ooh, so you wanna die young
