Year 09
Cutting the cord without a word
Oh why
You gave me things that I never had
So why?
Would I go and leave and you like that
Goodbye

Time past me by but I didn't try
Wondered if you ever sought closure
All I need is some closure

I'm the man who's always running from myself
And never stopped for anybody else
I'm just chasing after something I don't know
And I left you in the rear view all alone
Hopped in my car, put in the keys, drive

A year passed
And I had gotten over her but she ain't last
Next there was my brother yeah we had a past
Going back forever but it couldn't last, no

And I got lost in my life no one tried
No one ever sought any closure
All we needed was closure

I'm the man who's always running from myself
And never stopped for anybody else
I'm just chasing after something I don't know
And I left you in the rear view all alone
Hopped in my car, put in the keys, drive

Why, why did you lie?
Why did you fight me every step
Of the way, but anyways
I hope you're well cause I sure ain't
