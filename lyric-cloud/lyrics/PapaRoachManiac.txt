I woke up in the morning down a rabbit hole
My head is spinnin', think I might’ve lost control
I look around the room and I'm thinkin' "How’d I get here?"
Yeah

Was I the life of the party, was I a maniac?
I try to remember but nothing's coming back
Somebody call a doctor, better call the doctor
'Cause I think I'm losing it

Face first down this drain again
(I think I'm losing it)
Chasing problems in my head
Everybody says that I'm losing my shit
I should calm down, but you know I can't quit
(I'm losing it)
Face first down this drain again

Standing at a hotel, lookin’ in the mirror
’Cause everything's hazy and nothing seems clear

Am I a manic depressive, am I a maniac?
I see the reaper in people until they fade to black
Somebody call a doctor, better call the doctor
’Cause I think I'm losing it

Face first down this drain again
(I think I'm losing it)
Chasing problems in my head
Everybody says that I'm losing my shit
I should calm down, but you know I can’t quit
(I'm losing it)
Face first down this drain again
(And now I'm losing it)

I've been living in my anxiety
I've been living in my anxiety
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(M-m-m-maniac)

I've been living in my anxiety
(M-m-m-maniac)
I've been living in my anxiety
(M-m-m-maniac)
I've been living in my anxiety
I've been living in my anxieties
