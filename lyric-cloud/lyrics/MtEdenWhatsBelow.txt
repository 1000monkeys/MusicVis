(Feat. Mc Woody)
I don't know what's going on
What's right from wrong
And all this time everybody's telling me to be strong
But you know it's hard to be strong
When this shit is so wrong
Wanting me to get up and move on or even know that you're gone
I feel so twisted
I need this weight lifted off my shoulders
Cause every day without you turns colder
And all the wasted minutes get me down a feel older
I was torn apart
And now I'm lost and lonely now it's over
I don't know what's going on
What's right from wrong
And all this time everybody's telling me to be strong
But you know it's hard to be strong
When this shit is so wrong
Wanting me to get up and move on or even know that you're gone
I feel so twisted
I need this weight lifted off my shoulders
Cause every day without you turns colder
And all the wasted minutes get me down a feel older
I was torn apart
And now I'm lost and lonely now it's over
