You still got my attention, boy, you onto something
Creep on you, nigga, why would I ever, ever?
You could be the one man that could get it from me
So you can leave your heart open, fall in love in slow motion
To call me your 
dime is
 a victory
My beauty’s the loudest, you should be the proudest
Your skin on my skin is the shit to me
I got what was missing, I fit the description, that’s why I’m your Queen
I’m happy you got one 'cause one of these hoes should not be an option
I kill 'em and get away, no Johnnie Cochran
Priorities wrong if I ain't the top one and that's real you gotta believe this shit
Them other dudes losing on you, I've been choosing
And I swear to God I'm in need of this
If you leave with nothing, boy leave with this

Why would I wanna fuck all that up? Yeah
