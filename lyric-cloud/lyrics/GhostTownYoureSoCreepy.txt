For so long now I've been coming to your rescue
(Got me thinking I'll get you)
And I'm serious when I say I'm over it, I'm over it
(And your fucking lies)
That you'll stick around
Stay on my side of town
Now I'm covered in blood
And I'm feeding off your pretty little lies

For once why can't you just come and chase me
Dig up my grave and save my body
Now I'm rotting to the bone
But my heart's still beating
Hoping you won't leave me

Creepy girls, you're just my style
Blood-red lipstick, you don't smile
Falling victim to your fantasy
Damn, I love it that you're so creepy

Now you're risking it all
For some creepy girl
With a blacked-out rage that'll cast a spell
Don't tempt her, she's got those evil eyes

Now you're risking it all for some pin-up doll
Who drinks in the AM, fucks in the PM
Treats all the boys like she don't need 'em

Creepy girls, you're just my style
Blood-red lipstick, you don't smile
Falling victim to your fantasy
Damn, I love it that you're so creepy
Creepy girls, you're just my style
Blood-red lipstick, you don't smile
Falling victim to your fantasy
Damn, I love it that you're so creepy
Creepy girls, you're just my style
Blood-red lipstick, you don't smile
Falling victim to your fantasy
Damn, I love it that you're so creepy
