Hold on to mornings, hold on so tight
When you crawl through these moments with that fear locked inside
Waving off the tracks as life passes by
Oh I'm a ghost of my life

How long I sailed without passing my homeland
Felt all the emptiness in the palm of your hands
Oh boy, keep sailing right into these evening skies
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I'm a ghost, so cold living in my shadow
Into the night, into the night of gold
All these memories unknown, leaving before these breakdowns
Into the light, into the light of gold

Blinding shadows, blinding lights
Climbing that safety rope until it blinds your sight
Growing and growing till the beast comes alive
I'm a ghost of my life

The cold wind is blowing upon the deep
Buried away under these hands of memories
Saving what is left of scarred paradise
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I'm a ghost, so cold living in my shadow
Into the night, into the night of gold
All these memories unknown, leaving before these breakdowns
Into the light, into the light of gold
