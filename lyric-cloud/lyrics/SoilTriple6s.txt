PART I
Bitch, I'm groovy
Crenshaw
Grippin' on the toolie
Bitch, don't choose me
I strike like lightning
So frightening
I'm biting
On sight and
I'm piping at night and
I'm so out of my mind
I know you're lying about trying to talk to them other guys
Stop crying
Please silence
Until I'm done tying the motherfucking noose
Why in the fuck do you even mind?
Don't you want me out of your life?
I'm so conflicted, give me time
Next day later, I just write
Why won't you hear out my sacrifice?

California scene
Spotlights, flashing beams
Women wear the weed
Bleachboys be my team
Crowd is too loud
Hook up one night and I'm out
Packing the weed
We on top of a cloud
Ask for my number because I got clout
Saving up lean while she giving me mouth
Look at my wrist while I'm throwing this cash
Wanting a feature but they be so trash
Rap game Ramadan, now I gotta fast
Leading the role, you ain't part of the cast
Making the money
I wanna get rich
Tasting like honey
I'm loving this bitch
Came from the bottom
I was a misfit
Drop another track and you know it's a hit
PART II
Hocus Pocus
Overdosing on juice
Smoking
Pistol toting
Garden gnome and
Gold is mowing
100 racks just for the showing
Flip your bitch
I got her moaning
I'm a gremlin
I be groaning
Toss your remnants in the ocean
Gotta dig 'cause aye is Sploof
Ask some questions, I'm not knowing
Better know my Glock my spokesman
Shouts out Reeves
Forgot that potent
Got your bitch
You know she blowing
Fuck a boat
Don't do no rowing
Be my neck
You know it's glowing
If a nigga talking smack
Blast him back like Sergeant Soap and
I spill trees don't do no growing
You steal bars
You niggas quoting
Diamonds white
Look like they Conan
Nemo backwards is just omen
Niggas copy
Shadow cloning
Can't fuck with you
You be bowing
I'm just talking
I'm not flowing
Where my bands at?
I know you owing
I took woods
They double coated
Bankroll thick
It is not folding
Snatch your bitch
She get to boning
Peep the polo
Know it's stolen
I don't grow but stacks is growing
I don't simp
Don't do no morbid
Fuck a bitch I need that golden
Tommy Jacket finely woven
Get your bread up
Your shit molding
Took your zip and then I sold it
I'm a pimp
The lean I'm pouring
Pistol grip
The Glock is golden
Pistol whip you in the dome and
Pin a bitch
I am not bowling
You smoke grass?
Lil nigga mowed it
Wrist is wet
That nigga Sploof now gone

Look how quick imma crash the whip
And I'm tripping off that potion
Coasting
Focus
Catch me floating
We the new waves of the ocean
God I'm roping 'til he's croaking
How much time 'til our plan's in motion?
Open scar being swarmed by locusts
My eyes red
Part the skull like Moses
Backseat blasting
Running up with the mask
Don't pray for help because your God is absent
Running from mass
Go straight to hell
The devil in me laughing
Lie with high brows
Got filled with shells to drop when my car is passing
Pull off so fast
Murder so well
I kill like it's my passion
Let me down
Let me in the Earth
Mind goes numb like I feel that lurk
Lost control, one side is blurred
Two shots pop and I hit the dirt
Two shots pop and I clear the place
No one's left so you can't escape
One boo hit put him in his grave

Loaded shotty in the trunk
Pop that bitch
It's time to dump
Mangled body
Smell like skunk
Oxycaution
Rebel punk
Popped a Xan
I'm looking drunk
Bleachboys
We don't fuck with chumps
All these drugs
I'm too damn slumped
Now my Draco got 'em stumped
My 30 round clip
Made 'em flip
Now his body's ripped
AK bullets flying through his skull
Now his brains are split
Too damn lit
Now I'm catching bodies while the perckies got me sick
It's no contest
I'm sipping Hi-Tech while I write this
Satanic conscience
C'mon let's see how sharp my knife is
B-U-R-Y
Don't run inside it's time to fucking die
H-O-M-I
I like to kill
In love with homicide
Come and ask me
"Who am I?"
See the darkness in my eyes
Go and hide
I will just cause havoc 'til the day my brothers rise
PART III
Goddamn, bitch
I am not a Bleach Boy
Yung Soup trapping
Got you yelling sheesh, boy!
Spicy killer coming straight off the leash, boy
Fuck a dope dealer
Pull up with the heat, boy

Don't fuck with a god some may call me delirious
What prompted my ways got you dumbasses curious
Don't ask for a verse, hoe
Don't make me get furious
Picking up grams the same number that Curry is
Krow has arrived, sweeping down with my talons
Taking narcotics
Sip lean by the gallons
Remember that I used to be happy inside
Now I wanna get high and drive off a mountain

Pussies want a feature like they is a fucking leech
Living off our clout like bitch, I'll cut you in your sleep
Ghetto side, ghetto side
Losing my mind
Not with this doubt
We will leave you behind
Sever the spine
It is your time
Fuck with a bitch and then you will go blind

Drum mag
Bullets hit you quick like we playing tag
Ammo bag
Now I gotta give this bitch a heart attack
Never lack unless you wanna be inside a body bag
Pulled the trigger back
Here's my wrath
Blood bath

1 whip
2 hounds
Hop out, lose a pound
3 bricks
4 licks
5 dead roam the town
Triple 6's and 7 bitches
8 bodies in the trenches
I'm cloud 9, twitching
10 letters the vision

Flames covered, drowning Pontiac
I'm fleeing to your bitch's trap
"Hey can I hop on the track?"
Into my bin, I don't do demands
Someone come and get their mans
Bleaching all the fans
Riding our coattails, dragging 'em by
I got dragon scales
Give 'em hell
Soup in a Holy Grail
Crucified hammer to the fucking nail
Flaming since Chain Mail

Black soul, that's how it's been
Music dark like a deadly sin
No razor pressed against my skin
Because I know I'll always win
Bleachboys
Say your prayer
Living my life like a motherfucking slayer
Insanity plugged in my mind is a demon inside black tar that's burning my paper

Bathing in the bleach
Don't step in my path
Slurring up my speech
I dropped some Xanax in my glass
Oxycaution, demon lord
Just please don't make me mad
Or else I'll have to go and kill your motherfucking dad
