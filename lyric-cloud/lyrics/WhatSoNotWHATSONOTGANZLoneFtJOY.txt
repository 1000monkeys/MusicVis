Was I ever more than something on your mind?
Do you miss me not being by your side?
By your side?
Well, I thought that I was someone to you
Well, I just wanted to be a home to you
By your side

You held another in your arms
You dropped me like a stone
And now you're pulling me back in
When it's quiet and alone
I let you under my skin
I let you leak into my veins
And now I can't see clearly
I want you all to melt away

How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I lose?

Well, I thought that I was someone to you
Well, I just wanted to be a home to you

How can I choose when I'm losing either way?

You held another in your arms
You dropped me like a stone
And now you're pulling me back in
When it's quiet and alone
I let you under my skin
I let you leak into my veins
And now I can't see clearly
I want you all to melt away

Cause I'm losing either way
Cause I'm losing either way

Take this slow
Cause it's moving too fast
There's a warmth in your heart
There's a cold in your grasp
Da da-da da-da
Da da-da da-da da
Da da-da da-da
Da da-da da-da da

How can I choose when I'm losing either way?
How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I lose?
How can I choose when I'm losing either way?
How can I choose when I'm losing either way?
How can I choose when I'm losing either way?

How is it a choice when I'm begging you to stay?
