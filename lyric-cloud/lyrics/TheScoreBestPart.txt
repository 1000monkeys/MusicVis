I can be a liar, I can be a cheat
I can be neurotic, I can be a freak
I can be everything in between
But you always find the best part
The best part of me

I just wanna say I'm sorry
Some days, I know get out of hand
I wish that I was anybody else
I'm a wreck but you understand

I can't take myself
I'm just not well
My own worst enemy
I can't help myself
Think I'm going to hell
I'll probably never leave

I can be a liar, I can be a cheat
I can be neurotic, I can be a freak
I can be colder than a rolling stone
You know I hate it when I'm left alone
Even at my best, yeah, I can be the worst
I can be a head case, spin you in reverse
I can be everything in between
But you always find the best part
The best part of me

You're not looking for a halo
You said there's more to me than I can see
You swore that it would be okay though
'Cause you'll learn to let the pain go
Everyone's got demons underneath

I can't take myself
I'm just not well
My own worst enemy
I can't help myself
Think I'm going to hell
I'll probably never leave

I can be a liar, I can be cheat
I can be neurotic, I can be a freak
I can be colder than a rolling stone
You know I hate it when I'm left alone
Even at my best, yeah, I can be the worst
I can be a head case, spin you in reverse
I can be everything in between
But you always find the best part
The best part of me
The best part of me

I can't take myself
I'm just not well
My own worst enemy
I can't save myself
So I'll give 'em hell
This is me

I can be a liar, I can be cheat
I can be neurotic, I can be a freak
I can be colder than a rolling stone
You know I hate it when I'm left alone
Even at my best, yeah, I can be the worst
I can be a head case, spin you in reverse
I can be everything in between
But you always find the best part
The best part of me
The best part of me
The best part of me
