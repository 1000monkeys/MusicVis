In a world that turns, an empty page
Colors fill my eyes when the day turns grey
And I'm closer now
To the path that takes me
Through all the doubts
Through all the clouds
From the blackest rooms and the darkest place
I have been returned
Oh I've been saved

And I'm closer now
To the path that takes me
Through all the doubts
Through all the clouds
And you're lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears away
To me you're mountains and oceans and everything words cannot say
All the stars aligned
You're my lullaby

My painted sky
My painted sky
(my painted sky). And you're lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears away
(my painted sky). To me you're mountains and oceans and everything words cannot say

From the blackest rooms and the darkest place
I have been returned
Oh I've been saved
And I'm closer now
To the path that takes me
Through all the doubts
Through all the clouds
Home sweet home but it never stays the gardens grown
But it feels the same

And I'm closer now
To the path that takes me
Through all the doubts
Through all the clouds
And you're lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears away
To me you're mountains and oceans and everything words cannot say
All the stars aligned
You're my lullaby

My painted sky
My painted sky
(my painted sky). And you're lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears away
(my painted sky). To me you're mountains and oceans and everything words cannot say
All the stars aligned
You're my lullaby
And you're lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears
And lightyears away
To me you're mountains and oceans and everything words cannot say
