To rise, to rule
Two heights I've never been
Cause your mouth's an avalanche
That won't let me breathe
No pride, no growth
No fight I'll ever win
Decisive evidence
But it won't set me free

Now please don't set it in stone
I'll try to leave again today
So please don't set it in stone
I'm just a drop against the wave
Regret
Regret

So in time but on hold
You'll learn the evident
If I'd be a better man
Then we'd rest in peace but
In spite enthralled
So to whatever end
I'll try to leap again
But don't grab my feet

Now please don't set it in stone
I'll try to leave again today
So please don't set it in stone
I'm just a drop against the wave
Regret

Can't get out, when all I want to lose won't stop now
And everything I choose will break down
I never wanted to stay this long with anyone
Can't get out, when all I want to lose won't stop now
And everything I choose will break down
For everything I did I now feel regret

Now please don't set it in stone
Na na na na na na na
Now please don't set it in stone
Na na na na na na na
So please don't set it in stone
Na na na na na na na
I'm just a drop against the wave
Regret
