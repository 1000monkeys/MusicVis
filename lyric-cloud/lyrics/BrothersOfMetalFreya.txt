There’s a goddess, love is her mark
She breathes life into all
She’s the master of death, of lust and of war
And her beauty is known wide and far
Queen of the Valkyries
The fiercest of cavalries (...for death, a legion...)
Into the night she rides
As the northern lights
With her band of sisters she will conquer all
All her enemies will fall
Within the darkness, comfort find
When in sorrow your heart bound
In her tears of red gold
Her lover, gone
Through night and through dawn
Missing, far at sea
In a feathered robe, she ventures forth
Her beloved to set free
Gods of Alfheim awaits a sign of the highborn child
Gone for years, searching for her one and only love
Found at last, lost at sea
Forever he will haunt her dreams
A tear of gold is shed by the priestess so true
With her band of sisters she will conquer all
All her enemies will fall
Within the darkness, comfort find
When in sorrow your heart bound
In her tears of red gold
Her lover, gone
Through night and through dawn
Missing, far at sea
In a feathered robe, she ventures forth
Her beloved to set free
