No pressure, no diamonds
Volcanoes keep on making these islands
No peace without violence
These hard times make me a giant

No light, no darkness
Dark times make me shine the brightest
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter

No pressure, no diamonds
Volcanoes keep on making these islands
No peace without violence
These hard times make me a giant

No light, no darkness
Dark times make me shine the brightest
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
