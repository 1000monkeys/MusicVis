I've got some blood on my knees
I've got this pain on a leash
I won't give into the thieves
There are no true guarantees
But I'm holding tight to belief
Watching it rise like a beast

Oh oh
I see the light at the end of the tunnel I know yeah
Oh oh
I'll ride the train to the end of the I'll keep running I know

I'm gonna keep on reaching for the next level
I'm gonna keep on searching for it forever
The next level
Let's get to work

Some wait for the phone to ring
They want that Hollywood dream
But life is no fantasy
We might be worn to the bone
We'll turn that iron to gold
Obsess and watch it unfold

Oh oh
I see the light at the end of the tunnel I know yeah
Oh oh
I'll ride the train to the end of the I'll keep running I know

I'm gonna keep on reaching for the next level
I'm gonna keep on searching for it forever
The next level
Let's get to work
Let's get to work
Let's get it, let's work
Let's get to work

Go ahead dig a grave you can't kill me
Don't you know it's in my bones do you feel me
Go to church roll the dice you can't trick me
This is history this is history

I'm gonna keep on reaching for the next level
I'm gonna keep on searching for it forever
The next level
Let's get to work
I'm gonna keep on reaching for the next level
I'm gonna keep on searching for it forever
The next level
Let's get to work
Let's get to work
Let's get to work
Let's get it, let's work
Let's get to work
