Down by the waves
We’re holding on to all that we have
We hold it all
But the rise of the tide has its own weight
And we’ll know that the cries in the wind
Are the lies that we lived
I’ll blame it on the fires that you lit
You’ll blame it on
All the lies n'the games, but we both played
I’d retire but I’m struck by a want-to-know

Can we rise?
Going our way through the night
Can we grow and unite will we
Come back to wait for
A greater dawn
We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
But we ain’t coming round
We ain’t coming round, round, round

Down by the weight
It threw me how you nighted the day
It throws me how
We’ll rely on the role that we’re both playing
I’d resign but I’m stuck in a need-to-know

Can we rise?
Going our way through the night
Can we grow and unite will we
Come back to wait for
A greater dawn
We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
But we ain’t coming round
We ain’t coming round, round, round

Come back to wait for
A greater dawn
We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
But we ain’t coming round
We ain’t coming round, round, round

All the way down
To fold a strong hand
Too great to overcome
Way down, way down

All the way down
To fold a strong hand
Too great to overcome
Way down, way down

All the way down
To fold a strong hand
Too great to overcome
Way down, way down

All the way down
To fold a strong hand
Too great to overcome
Way down, way down


We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
But we ain’t coming round
We ain’t coming round, round
We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
We’ll come back to wait for
A greater dawn
But we ain’t coming round
We ain’t coming round, round, rouuund
