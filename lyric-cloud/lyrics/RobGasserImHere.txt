I've got a question
If you'd hear me out, out
In your defense you never had a chance
So tell me straight
I won't go, this is our time now, I'm sure
Make no mistake
That we are closer then we're far
And brace for impact
and fight your fears afar
and brace for impact
I'm the future's engineer
And baby I'm here
