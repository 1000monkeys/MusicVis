I've been defeated, I begged for what I needed
I suffered, now I'm ready for war
Been through the struggle, black eyes, and bloody knuckles
But I don't feel the pain anymore

If blood don't tell you the truth
Then could you please cut me loose?
'Cause I've been wanting to die
If burning makes me a liar
Then come join me in the fire
I know you wouldn't survive
But I'll be burning alive

Alive, alive
I'll be burning alive
Alive, alive
I'll be burning alive

I met my demons and asked them for their reasons
I wrote their names in blood on the wall
They speak in riddles and meet me in the middle
They're quiet while they wait for the fall (-all)

If scars are makeup and paint
Then thanks for setting me straight
'Cause I've been living a lie
If burning makes me a liar
Then come join me in the fire
I know you wouldn't survive
But I'll be burning alive

Alive, alive
I'll be burning alive
Alive, alive
I'll be burning alive

I have a story
I won't be sorry it's told
Is it real or fantasy?
Outrun the monsters after me
You'd be praying for a savior to arrive
I'll be patient in the flames
While I'm burning alive

Alive, alive
I'll be burning alive
Alive, alive
I'll be burning alive
I'll be burning alive
