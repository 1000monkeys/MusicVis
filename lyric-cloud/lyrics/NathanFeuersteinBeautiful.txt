There she goes
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful, yeah
But she's so broke
She's so incredible, wonder if she'll ever know, yeah, oh

She lays in her bedroom and she cries
Yeah she cries (Whoa)
And she feels depressed as tears fall from her eyes
From her eyes (Whoa)
All she wants is love, but she never finds it
In herself (Whoa)
And she just feels broken, I can tell that she's hopeless
Looking for help (Whoa)

And there she goes
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful (Whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible, I wonder if she'll ever know (Whoa)

She gets attention from every direction
But she doesn't care (Whoa)
She prays for protection, scared of rejection
Is anyone there? (Whoa)
She used to laugh, but now she's crying
Sick of the pain (Whoa)
She puts on her mask, pretends, and she acts
Like she's okay (Whoa)

And there she goes
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful (Whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible, I wonder if she'll ever know (Whoa)

There she goes again, putting on that fake act
Hard to see the real her when she got that fake mask
Daddy left it, he ain't never came back
Tears her apart but, she would never say that
She wants love, but don't know where to get it from
It's hard to learn respect from a man that never gave her none
So she cries and she yelling in the mirror
"Is anybody out there? Does anybody care?"
And people think they know her, but they don't really have a clue
Working three jobs, yeah she's doing what she have to do
Getting stressed out, and boys say she's beautiful
But that don't really mean a thing if she don't believe it though
Insecurity starting to take over
She looking for warmness but keeps getting colder
Yeah, I know ya tripping on your looks and such
But quit looking to world, and start looking up
God made you beautiful

And there she goes
She's so beautiful, she's so beautiful (Whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible, I wonder if she'll ever know (Whoa)
