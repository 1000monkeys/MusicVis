Who! Who!
Who! Who!
Who! Who!
Who! Who!

You once were someone
I could dignify (Ah! Ah!)
A guiding force, in which
I thought I could rely
I watched as you
Began to metamorphosize (Ah!)
Can't face it anymore
It's eating me alive

I'm not able to recognize
Where does the answer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who! Who! Who
The hell are you?
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?

You were someone
In whom I could confide (Ah! Ah!)
But you pushed me further away
With every single lie
You used to have a soul
But it has surely died (Ah!)
What happened?
When did you turn
To the other side?

No longer able to recognize
For every word's a lie
You are forever changed
And there's nothing more
That I can do

Who! Who! Who
The hell are you?
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?

Oh...

You and I, we were once so...
You and I, it was once incredible
You and I, we were once so...
You and I, we were indivisible
You and I, we were once
Two of a kind
Where did all your innocence go?
Now I wonder how it happened
That you and I, we were once so...
You and I, we were once inseparable
You and I, we were once like
Gemini, it was undeniable
You and I, we were once two of a kind
Where did my deliverance go?
Can there be a mend to this divide?

I'm not able to recognize
Where does the answer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who! Who! Who
The hell are you?
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?

(Where does the answer lie?
Where does the answer lie?
It's eating me alive)
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?
(Where does the answer lie?
Where does the answer lie?
It's eating me alive)
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?
Who! Who! Who
The fuck are you?
