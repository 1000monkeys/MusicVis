You put colour into my life
Before you it was black and white
Dark in the corners, you bathe me in light
You're a rainbow in a grey and cloudy sky

Everything looked sepia, sepia
Before you came along and saturated me with love
Then I couldn't be happier, happier
Oh, since you showed me how
There's more to life than what I thought there was

Now I see
Since you came along and saturated me with love
My mind is free
Free letting positivity
You put colour into my life
Now the future looks bright
When all hope is fading and I'm losing sight
You are a beacon of light

Everything looked sepia, sepia
Before you came along and saturated me with love
Then I couldn't be happier, happier
Oh, since you showed me how
There's more to life than what I thought there was

Now I see
Since you came along and saturated me with love
My mind is free
Free letting positivity

(Your love, your love, your love is setting me free
Your love, your love, your love is setting me free
Your love, your love, your love is setting me free
Your love, your love, your love is setting me free
Your love, your love, your love is setting me free)

Everything looked sepia
Before you came along and saturated me with love
Then I couldn't be happier, happier
Oh, since you showed me how
There's more to life than what I thought there was
Everything looked sepia
Before you came along and saturated me with love
And I couldn't be happier
Since you showed me how
There's more to life than what I thought there was
