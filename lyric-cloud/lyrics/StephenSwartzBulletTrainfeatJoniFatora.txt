Like a, like a, like a bullet train

Movin' like the speed of sound
Feet can't keep on the ground
Can't stay in one place
Keep movin' like a bullet train
Like a bullet train
Movin' like the speed of sound
Feet can't keep on the ground
Can't stay in one place
Keep movin' like a bullet train
Like a bullet train

Like, like, like a bullet train
Like, like, like a bullet train
One place
(Damn)
Like, like, like a bullet—shh
Like, like, like a bullet—shh, train
Train

'Cause I can't stop time
You keep blurring in my mind
And space is undefined
These tracks left behind
We can't stay the same
Can't stop this train
I can't find the brakes
On this bullet train

'Cause I can't stop
Stop
One place
(Damn)
Like, like, like a bullet—shh
Like, like, like a bullet—shh
Like
Like, like, like a bullet train
