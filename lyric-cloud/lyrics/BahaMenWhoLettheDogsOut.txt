Well the party was nice, the party was pumpin' 
(Hey, Yippie-Yi-Yo)
And everybody havin' a ball 
(Hah, ho, Yippie-Yi-Yo)
Until the fellas started name callin' 
(Yippie-Yi-Yo)
And the girls respond to the call
I heard a woman shout out

"Who let the dogs out?"

I see ya' little speedboat head up our coast
She really want to skip town
Get back gruffy, back scruffy
Get back you flea-infested mongrel!

Gonna tell myself, "Hey man no get angry" 
(Hey, Yippie, Yi, Yo)
To any girls calling them canine, hey!
 
(Yippie, Yi, Yo)
But they tell me "Hey Man, It's part of the Party!" 
(Yippie Yi, Yo)
You put a woman in front and her man behind 
(Yippie, Yi, Yo)
I heard a woman shout out

Well if I am a dog, the party is on
I gotta get my groove cause my mind done gone
Do you see the rays comin' from my eye
Walking through the place
That Diji man is breakin' it down?
Me and My white short shorts
And I can't see color, any color will do
I'll stick on you, that's why they call me Pitbull
Cause I'm the man of the land
When they see me they say Woo!

Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
