I love you more than money
Love you more than dope
Know I got a temper
But if it came down to it
Up against the ropes
I'll be in your corner

Gonna just come out and say it
I think both of us are crazy
But I love you anyhow
It's just how we get down
One of us lost and the other is found
I found myself a partner
Even though it's getting darker
If you feel like hope is gone
We can make it 'till dawn
Baby, we gotta just keep holding on

Don't let me go, don't let me go
I can't take it
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
You know that I'm your ride or die
So quit thinking
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun

I hate your taste in music
Hate it when you smoke
But your kiss is fire
And if I said I'd leave you
If I said it goes
Then I'd be a liar

Gonna just come out and say it
I think both of us are crazy
But I love you anyhow
It's just how we get down
One of us lost and the other is found
I found myself a partner
Even though it's getting darker
If you feel like hope is gone
We can make it 'till dawn
Baby, we gotta just keep holding on

Don't let me go, don't let me go
I can't take it
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
You know that I'm your ride or die
So quit thinking
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun

You can't let me go
I'm your radio
Keep on turning me up
Oh, you can't let me go
I'm your radio
Keep on turning me up
