My mother, she told me, "don't get in trouble"
My father, he told me he knew I would
My brothers, they told me, "don't give a damn"
My sister, she told me to do something good

I'm uncontrollable, emotional
Chaotically proportional
I'm visceral, reloadable
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted

My mother, she told me, "don't be a quitter"
My father, he told me he knew I was
My brothers, they told me, "do what you do"
My sister, she told me to do something good

I'm uncontrollable, emotional
Chaotically proportional
I'm visceral, reloadable
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted

My mother, she told me
My father, he told me
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)

Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
