Fever thoughts
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
I got these fever thoughts
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
My mind is climbing up the walls
Tellin' me I'm stupid 'cause he knows he's in control
Laughin' at me crazy 'cause he knows I can't get hope
Runnin' round in circles
I'm just starin' into space
And now I'm wide awake
And now I'm wide awake, ay

We don't get no sleep, we don't get no, we don't get no sleep
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no, we don't get no sleep
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no, we don't get no sleep

They say you flyin' high before you come down
I don't need to come down
Need to find a fuckin' way to get these thoughts out
Deep inside this daydream
Lights can't seem to stop it
I need the sleep, it's costing me my sanity

And now it's getting light
Damn right, damn right
This is a feeling that I recognize
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
I feel emotional as
I don't know what time it is
But dammit I'm still up
Body don't feel comfortable, tryna readjust
Catchin' that delirium, I'm restless
Where are you now?
These thoughts are taking me down this rabbit hole
Red and white stripes are painting over these eyes
I'm fadin' slow (Slow, slow)

We don't get no sleep, we don't get no, we don't get no sleep
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no, we don't get no sleep
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no, we don't get no sleep
We don't get no sleep

They say you flyin' high before you come down
I don't need to come down
Just need to find a fuckin' way to get these thoughts out
Deep inside this daydream
Lights can't seem to stop it
I need the sleep, it's costing me my sanity

And now it's getting light (We don't get no sleep, we don't get no)
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
I got these fever thoughts (We don't get no sleep, we don't get no)
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
I got these
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no
We don't get no sleep, we don't get no sleep, we don't get no

Fever thoughts
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
I got these fever thoughts
Can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep, can't sleep
I got these fever thoughts
