Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
I got a lot on my mind
I want to tell you I'm wrong
I want to tell you that I f-cked up
I'm gonna tell you the truth
This will cripple your eyes
It's going to hurt for a time
But if you let me out I'll make it right
Oh my
Oh my
It's my fault that you
It's my fault that that you
It's my fault that you
It's my fault that that you
It's my fault that you walking away
I told you ten times it's time for a change
And I don't blame you thinking I'm full of it
If you let me honey, I'll be proud of you
?Safetyâ€¦.? favorite sound
This is crazy 'cause I'm over it
Yeah cause I'm over it
And I thought that it would change
But you gave me a reason to stay away
We stay the same and I think about the fall
You gave me a reason we're wrong at all
We never win
It's my fault that you walking away
I told you ten times it's time for a change
And I don't blame you thinking I'm full of it
If you let me honey, I'll be proud of you
Safety ? favorite sound
This is crazy cause I'm over it
Yeah 'cause I'm over it
'Cause I'm over
