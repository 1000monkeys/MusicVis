We both speak in foreign tongues
We both speak in foreign tongues
We both speak in foreign tongues
We both speak in foreign tongues

You might see her all the time
But I'm the one you think of
You fall asleep with her
But I'm the one you dream of
I can hear you all the time
I'm the only thing you speak of
I can see it in your eyes
I'm the only thing you seek for

We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you


In the middle of the night
You wish I was by your side
But I got one thing on my mind
Can you just leave this all behind
And even though you're still with her
I'm the only thing you chase down
Take your wicked little games and listen to my own sounds

We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
We both speak in foreign tongues, don't you?
I've been liking it a lot about you
