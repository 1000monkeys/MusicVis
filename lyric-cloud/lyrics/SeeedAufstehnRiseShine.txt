This is Seeed ya
Everybody wake up
Forget your strive
Embrace life and check this

Yau, you are my princess baby ,nothing less
Love you in a skirt pretty girl ohh
I confess deeper in my chest
Feel is your love is blessed
I alone is a big mess
But together we can walk
Or leave this hard dress
So baby go and get dressed
We 're going for a test
Doing some crazyness yes
Climb Mount Everest
East to the west will be a kingdom of happiness
I am your emperior you are my empress yes

Move girl let's get out of bed
This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio, this tune I have to spread

Waaake up ,girl its now and ever
We 've been sleeping to long
I'm afraid life's almost over
Taaake off the nasty shell around you
Let's go for what we lost way back so long ago
I want to see your funny side again
Take me to your heart where it all began
I promise I'll do all I can for
This is the very last chance
To let our love light shine again

Move girl let's get out of bed
This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio, this tune I have spread

Wake up woman
There's something that I want you to see
A brand new you and me
Here just waitin to be
Here is my hand
So meet me half of the way
Sweatheart we 're sharing this day
And I don't wish to stay
The way that I am
I see the circumstances are strange
How I want you to change
But still stay the same
The less that we talk
The more time to try
And while you were sleeping
Time pass by

Girl let's get out of bed
This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio, this tune I have to spread
Move girl let's get out of bed
This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio, cause this tune I have to spread
