Tell me a lie
Tell me you love me one more time
Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
Tell me you love me one more time
Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie

And tell me a lie
Tell me you love me one more time
Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
Tell me you love me one more time
Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie

Tell me a lie
Tell me you love me one more time
Only for a while
Make me believe I'm on your mind
And tell me a lie
