(Get ready)
(Get ready, get set)
(Get ready, get set, let's roll)

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

S. O. B
You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90
Huh huh, 
goosebumps when
 the cops behind me, yo
The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs
Enjoy your doughnuts, Sir, you ain't gonna find me
It's not likely their brains is blown out
You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down
Hundred proof octane, ready to drink, bitch
Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip
Time's up, the animals crept through
Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws
Skin and bones let mess with your chrome set
Tricked out, hopping like your cruise in a cold chest
Park that eagle with a safety pin
Take the backseat, now let the games begin, yeah

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)

Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
The big boss spray-painted on my mud flap
Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff
Can never get enough
Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
You're playing with the sharks, step inside
Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride
That's right, put the pedal to the metal and go
The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
So quick, get in the palm trees, look out, whoa
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button, that'll smoke any whip you own
I told you I don't want to close your casket
Quit now before you go blowing a gasket

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)

(Go, go, go)
Melting, meltdown!
While time is shifting
Transist, transform! (out purposely)
Yielding, bending
While time is shifting
Two shapes that can't get straight
(Get ready, get set, let's roll)

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
If you want it, come and let me know
I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and (go!)
(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)
