She's so fierce and full of that fire, what's a boy to do
She yells and I crumble, she's got the power
She's barely five foot two

She's a hurricane
Hurricane

I see the waves crashing in the harbor just beyond the break
I should run and hide with the others, but I can't look away

She's a hurricane
And I hear thunder
But I won't run, I won't run

I want to meet her, I want to see her dancing in the street
I want to feel her, I want to hold her body close to me, yeah

But she's a hurricane
Hurricane

Lost in the riot, peace and quiet in the wanderlust
I'll be hers and she'll be mine from dust to dust

She's a hurricane
And I hear thunder
But I won't run, I won't run

The sun is rising, the rain is falling
I'm going to give you all that's left of me
I will run
I will run into the hurricane

You're my hurricane
She's a hurricane
