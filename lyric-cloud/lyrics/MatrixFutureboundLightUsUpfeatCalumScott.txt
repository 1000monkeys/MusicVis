Nothing is sacred
Nothing is set in stone
Nothing is precious, you can let it go
You gotta love it
You gotta light the fire
Turning the ashes into solid gold

It’s hard to live a lie
When you’ve seen the light
When you’ve seen the light
When did we get so tired?
How did it take so long?
Tell me why my heart is bruised and
So confused, it feels so wrong
Where do we belong?
When did we get so scared of losing?
Just light the fuse and

Light us up
Take us to higher ground
Don’t let our love fall down
Light us up
Take all our darkest days
Throw all our dirt away
And light us up

Trying to listen
Trying to catch my breath
They got a way of keeping my head down

It’s hard to live a lie
When you’ve seen the light
When you’ve seen the light
When did we get so tired?
How did it take so long?
When did we get so scared of losing
Just light the fuse and

Light us up
Take us to higher ground
Don’t let our love fall down
Light us up
Take all our darkest days
Throw all our dirt away

When did we get so tired?
How did it take so long?
When did we get so scared of losing?
When did we get so tired?
How did it take so long?
Tell my why my heart is bruised and
So confused, it feels so wrong
Where do we belong?
When did we get so scared of losing?
Just light the fuse and

Light us up
Take us to higher ground
Don’t let our love fall down
Light us up
Take all our darkest days
Throw all our dirt away
And light us up
