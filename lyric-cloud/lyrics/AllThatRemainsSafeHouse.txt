Before you knew which house it was
I knew where you'd come in
Welcome, I've been waiting
To think you'd find your victim here
Will be your fatal sin
Welcome, I've been waiting
The lights were out, the car was gone
The door was left unlocked
You've already been caught
The path was laid, the road was fresh
And every gun was cocked
You've already been caught

Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now?
Semi-automatic
I don't panic when it goes down
Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now?
AKA your god's away
There's no one you can call now

Do you feel safe now?
Do you feel safe now?
Do you feel safe now?
Do you feel safe now?

The kitchen then the hall
There was no other path to take
You don't know it's too late
One more room to guide you
Through then show you your mistake
You don't know it's too late
The moment I'm behind you
And you know what it's about
And you're forsaken now
By the time you think to run
You're starting to bleed out
You did not let me down

Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now?
Semi-automatic
I don't panic when it goes down
Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now?
AKA your god's away
There's no one you can call now

Do you feel safe now?
Do you feel safe now?
Do you feel safe now?
Do you feel safe now?

Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now?
Semi-automatic
I don't panic when it goes down
Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now?
AKA your god's away
There's no one you can call now

Welcome
