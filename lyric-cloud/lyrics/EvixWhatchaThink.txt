Well, the devil came to my house, knocked on my door
I said, "Oh my, I know that I have heard this voice before"
He said, "You're quite a talent, the makings of a star
And with a little help from me you really can go far"
I'll tell you what I told the rest, the rules remain the same
Don't glorify, support or ever mention Jesus' name
Now you can do something that's positive but just don't misbehave
Like use your notoriety and get somebody saved
And don't you be so vocal about the truth you know
The Bible's bad for business, leave your faith at home
I'll give you wealth and fame, far as the eye can see
Live the way you want but your career belongs to me
The he smiled a crooked smile, winked an evil eye
And said, "Well, whatcha think, my man?"
This was my reply
I have been bought with a price when Jesus hung on a tree
My life is not my own, I'll never follow your lead
You build up all the pleasure of sin in people's eyes
But never tell the consequences of the compromise
You used to have my number but this time you will fail
So get thee behind me, Satan, I'm not 4 sale
