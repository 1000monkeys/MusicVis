It's the price I guess
For the lies I've told
That the truth
It no longer thrills me

And why can't we laugh
When it's all we have?
Have we put these childish things away?
Have we lost the magic that we once had?

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

Will you dance with me
Like we used to dance
And remember
How to move together?

You are the torch
And it all makes sense
I've waited here for you forever
I've waited here for you forever

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

We're lost 'til we learn how to ask
We're lost 'til we learn how to ask
We are lost 'til we learn how to ask
So please, please just ask

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
