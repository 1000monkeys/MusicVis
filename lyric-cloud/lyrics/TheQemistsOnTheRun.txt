Destination x21 I'm on the run!
They know it's my destination
Cross the line and I'm lost forever more
Keep lookin' over my shoulder (Keep lookin oh keep looking)
If I'm caught, it's the end of it, it's the end of it
I'm on the run!
Run, run x16
Need a ride to the boarder baby
The feeling's sending me under
I wanna cool down, find somewhere shady
Until this thing has blown over
I'm on the run!
Destination x21
It's the end of it x8
It's the x12
It's the end of it
I'm on the run!
Need a ride to the boarder baby
The feeling's sending me under
I wanna cool down, find somewhere shady
Until this thing has blown over
I'm on the run!
Destination x21
Run, run x15
