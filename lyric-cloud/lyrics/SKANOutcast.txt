Run into my ghost now
Pull up in zone now
You can hate the hustle never slow down
You can hate the hustle never slow down
Hustle never slow down
Hustle never slow down
It never slow down
Hustle never slow down

I used to be that kid that every day would get rejected
Picked on and laughed at, was barely respected
And when it came to my friends, I was neglected
But momma told keep on pushin' had to keep on steppin'
Up, until I made to that balcony
She said "when I'm on top and  nobody lookin' down on me"
She said that "I see fake love and fake smiles surroundin' me"
Forget the popularity, dreams, results is houndin' me
I'm proud to more than what they said I would
Doin' things I never could, but livin' life inside a hood
Hit n' runs I'm headin' home, but I ain't livin' like I'm shook
Could never be a one to one, I'm versatile, I double you
This game is a popup, but you can't let it trouble you
If I can get it done I guarantee that my genie could

Three wishes, miss fittin' in? Nah, I'd rather be the outcast
'Cause in the endgame the outcasts get the last laugh

I got the last laugh

Run into my ghost now
Pull up in zone now
You can hate the hustle never slow down
You can hate the hustle never slow down

Now I'm rode in this thing we call life
Seein' celebrities all in the hype
Make you wonder if you doin' it right
This the life everybody could live
I understand that it's all about hype
'Bout the time if the timing is right
I believe in the station we work
Till our bodies buried under the dirt

Why'd you go when you runnin' the tune
All the mans when they runnin' on you
Tip you off and the balance on you
But make the gold when they countin' on you
Why'd you go when you runnin' the tune
All the mans when they runnin' on you
Tip you off and the balance on you
But make the gold when they countin' on you
Always step down to the best now we can flex now that we here
No rest now we bust down everything we touch and we own

Had three wishes, three times, wish to be the only outcast
Worked my way to the top now, I got the last laugh
