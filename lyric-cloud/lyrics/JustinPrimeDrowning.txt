Chasing shadows
And the memories of ours
Feeling hollow inside
And maybe we just rock to hard
And now we have just broken hearts
Why does it hurt when I'm breathing?
Why does it hurt to walk away?
You were my heart, you kept me beating
So, Who am I now?
I have to figure it out 'cause I'm drowning, drowning, drowning
Figure it out cause I'm drowning, drowning, drowning, dro-o-o-oh

Turning pages, but my book has no words
Nothing changes
And maybe we just rock to hard
And now we have just broken hearts
Why does it hurt when I'm breathing?
Why does it hurt to walk away?
You were my heart, you kept me beating
So, Who am I now?
I have to figure it out, 'cause I'm drowning, drowning, drowning
Figure it out, cause I'm drowning, drowning, drowning
