Oh, how quickly I come undone
Like melting ice on the sun
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream
Oh, you watch me and I'm exposed
Like lightning bolts in my bones
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream

Midnight daydream
Midnight daydream

Oh, how quickly I come undone
Like melting ice on the sun
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream
Oh, you watch me and I'm exposed
Like lightning bolts in my bones
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream

Midnight daydream
Midnight daydream
