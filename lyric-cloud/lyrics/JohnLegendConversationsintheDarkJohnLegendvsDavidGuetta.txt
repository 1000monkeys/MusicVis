Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you

And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are

I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you

On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep wherever next to you, next to you

And you say that you're not worth it
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are

I won't ever try to change you, change you (Yeah)
I will always want the same you, same you (Oh-oh)
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart (Yeah)
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely (Oh, when you get lonely)
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me (Yeah-yeah)
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you (Yeah-yeah)
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I won't ever try to change you, change you
(Oh, when you get lonely)

I won't break your heart
