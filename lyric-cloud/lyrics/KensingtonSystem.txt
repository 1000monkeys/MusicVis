Gone down in a spiral again
Either pull up or dive in descent
But I hold on to lies with a grin
That I know where to go, that I like where I stand
And when I light it again
I’ll breathe in then forget how to breathe out
So I’ll decide it again
How my low is my high, how my up is my down
But no, don’t ever leave me out, here
(Gave it away, gave it away)
I got a system
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But it breaks me up
(Gave it away, gave it away)
It’s my decision
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But I feel like a fool
And all I am trying to gain
I’ll seed it then forget how to reap now
So I’ll deny it again
How your wrong is my right
How your luck is my doubt
But no, don’t ever leave me out, here
(Gave it away, gave it away)
I got a system
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But it breaks me up
(Gave it away, gave it away)
It’s my decision
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But I feel like a fool
(Gave it away, gave it away)
I got a system
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But it breaks me up
(Gave it away, gave it away)
It’s my decision
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But I feel like a fool
Don’t ever leave me out
Though you’re rolling your eyes again
Don’t ever leave me on
My own down here
Don’t ever leave me out
Though you’re putting up fights again
Don’t ever leave me all
The way down here ohhhh
(Gave it away, gave it away)
I got a system
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But it breaks me up
(Gave it away, gave it away)
It’s my decision
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But I feel like a fool
(Gave it away, gave it away)
I got a system
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But it breaks me up
(Gave it away, gave it away)
It’s my decision
(Gave it away, gave it away)
But I feel like a fool
(Gave it away, gave it away,Gave it away, gave it away
Gave it away, gave it away,Gave it away, gave it away)
