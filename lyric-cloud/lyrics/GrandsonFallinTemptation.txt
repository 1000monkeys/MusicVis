(Aye, aye, aye)

They told me the point was to get it
But nobody told me what I should do if I got it
Chasing the high, now I caught it
Same part of the brain as narcotics
One day I know I'll regret it
But numb to the pain I sip it, I hit it, I pop it
Everyday I'm tryna top it
Told me to stop it, changing the topic
Checking the like and the follow
It’s feeling the same as downing a Vicodin bottle
Living it like no tomorrow
Living this life but it’s hollow (Fuck)
Granny gone wild unstable
Life on the road has all of my demons enabled
Breaking it down on the table
Be careful though, it could be fatal

Im fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I said it was the last time last time
Wake me up, I’m fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I said it was the last time last time

Pushed her away then I lost her
In the DM, a stranger with a dangerous offer
All this self-loathing I foster
The mirror reflects an imposter
Swipe up and go through the motion
Obsessively posting, can't seem to live in the moment
I’m just a drop in the ocean
Everything’s fine, no emotion
The bank doesn’t mind all the tattoos
'Cause the cash rules
But it isn’t full-filling it's fast food
And you watch it go past you
Ain’t coming with you, ain’t gonna outlast you
Temptation telling me don’t let her in
Told her I’m leaving, I’m chasing this sin
And the only thing I learned from letting it win
Is never again (Never again)

Im fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I said it was the last time last time
Wake me up, I’m fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
Fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I said it was the last time last time

Temptation, temptation
I love you, but I'm falling
Temptation, temptation
I love you, but I'm falling
I said it was the last time last time

But I’m fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I’m fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I’m fallin'
I, I said it was the last time last time
Fuck it, now I’m fallin'
I’m fallin'
I’m fallin'
Aye, aye, aye
I’m fallin'
Fallin'
I said it was the last time last time
