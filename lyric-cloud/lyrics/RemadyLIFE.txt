I've been walking a thousand miles
To many places
And I know there's a reason why
Whatever I do
And the day that I met you
I would always find the way to make it right
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime
Everyday is a winding road
You gotta ride it
'Cause I know that I can't be wrong
Whatever I do
And as long as you're with me
We would always find the strength to carry on
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime

And these are the days of our life's
And these are the days of the days
Of your life

Of your life

It's how we learn and it's how we grow
I gotta be patient
All it takes is to let it go
I need to know
Even if the lights go out
Will you ever be the one who stay right by my side
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime

And these are the days of our life's
And these are the days of the days
Of your life

Of your life

We would always find the strength to carry on
Anyplace, anywhere, anytime
And these are the days of our life's
Of your life

Of your life
