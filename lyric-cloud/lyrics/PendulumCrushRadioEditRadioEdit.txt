I was running into the cold light
Wondering where to go
To run away without you
All my fear is coming home
And it's ripped out from the soul
You can't be me, I will become you tonight
Pictures that I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Returning to the future
I was wandering under black skies
Looking at what is mine
No control left to lose
Well, I thought that it wouldn't face me
But I'm worrying like a child, I feel so guilty
I'll make it up to you tonight
Pictures that I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Returning to the future
The nightmares I've been having have arrived
The change in my future
The sounds of my creation at my door
How could you do this to her?
Pictures that I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Returning to the future
