It was rare at the time and still is today for a rapper to have a religious song have mainstream success (peaking at number 11 on the Bilboard Hot 100).

-CLASH OF THE TITANS (2007)
Kanye West had become, along with 50 cent, the most popular hip hop artist of the day. Like 50 Ye’s first two albums were homeruns. With both of their albums being released that year, West decided to create a competition by moving his album release date to the exact same as 50 Cent’s “Curtis” This would create a highly publicized “feud” on who would sell more albums. 50 jokingly went as far as to say if Kanye sold more than him he would retire from making solo albums. The “feud” worked out well for both artists as the fans bought into it. Ultimately Mr. West would win the sales comp, outselling 50 by a landslide…
-STRONGER (2007)
Kanye’s winning streak would not end. With the summer release of “Stronger” which became his third single to top the charts, Ye hit another homerun. Stronger would also go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performace. The anticipation for the third album was monumental
-GRADUATION ARRIVES (2007)
September 11, 2007. One of the greatest dates in hip hop history as two heavyweight artists dropped their albums on the same day to see who would be the king of hip hop going into the future. With 957,000 copies to 691,000, Graduation blew Curtis completely out of the water. The album currently stands at 2.7 million units sold in the U.S. alone. Met with the usual critical success as well for Mr. West, this was a landmark album which like the two predecessors, took home the Grammy for Best Rap Album. Almost being seen as a turning point in hip hop history, as the future would see the mainstream dominated by more artists that shared personalities similar to Mr. West’s rather than the typical gangster persona that had dominated rap for over a decade. Thanks to Ye, the game was forever changed. He was truly at the peak of his career
-GOOD LIFE (2007)
About a month after the release of Graduation, Ye dropped his third single “Good Life” featuring T-Pain. It eventually took home yet another Grammy for Best Rap Song. This was the first single after the release of Kanye’s landmark, and the video helped display that Mr. West was indeed on top of the world. Good Life peaked at number 23 on the charts however the mass popularity of the song proved that whatever Ye touched turned to gold. The world was in the palm of his hands and it seemed that he was the unanimous choice as the #1 Hip Hop Artist in the game. MTV agreed as he was crowned #1 on their Hottest MCs in the Game list the following year
-808S & HEARTBREAK (2008)
November 24, 2008 saw the release of 808s & Heartbreak, a different direction Kanye decided to take musically. This was of course not the album everyone expected as the entire thing was Autotune. Most believe today that this album was largely driven by the death of his mother (god rest her soul) and his break-up with fiance Alexis Rainey. Initially, public reaction to the album was mixed, although critics praised it upon release. Even so, it was still a huge commercial success as it garnered 450,000 opening week and 1.7 million in the U.S. overall. As far as the influential impact, a lot of our new school rappers today have adopted the stylistic themes of this album and the sonic drive. Including Drake, who admitted that his breakthrough mixtape “So Far Gone” was largely modeled after 808s
-MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY (2010)
After almost a year or so somewhat hiatus, partly due to media scrutiny (Taylor Swift incident) and just simply wanting to take his time on the next album, Kanye returned to the scene with MBDTF. Opening weeks sales stood at 496,000 so Ye hadn’t lost a step commercially. And not only was his critical success outstanding, but the album received universal acclaim, some hailing it as Ye’s best work today. Metacritic gave it a 94/100, one of the highest scores given to any album. Once again, Ye hit a homerun
-WATCH THE THRONE (2011)
Kanye West and Jay-Z are longtime friends, labelmates, and fellow musicians. So they decided “hey what the hell, let’s make a collab album”. Well that’s exactly what they did as WTT was released on August 8th 2011 to 436,000 copies opening week and riveting digital sales to go along with it
-CRUEL SUMMER (2012)
Kanye decided to make another collaboration album but this time with his fellow GOOD MUSIC label. Cruel Summer dropped on September 14, 2012 to 205,000 opening week and not the greatest critical acclaim
-YEEZUS (2013)
This brings us to present day. Yeezus was released on June 18, 2013. This album garnered another sales competition which wasn’t nearly as monumental as Ye’s prior. However RocNation artist J. Cole decided to move his album date to correspond with Yeezy’s. Ultimately Ye won this competition as well with no promotion and no single released prior. Yeezus is certified platinum while Born Sinner has some catching up to do. Public reaction to Yeezus was the most mixed and probably the most negative out of any Kanye album. Fans were upset with the drastically different sound, lack of songs, and promotion. However, critics praised it highly, Metacritic gives it a score of 84/100
