Everybody thinks that they’re gonna rule the world
I’m just gonna learn how to play it
Give me all you got and I’ll turn it into gold
Let it go, let it go, let it go
I’m just living life with the pedal to the floor
Look into my eyes they’ll be blazing
Won’t you take my hand and I’ll show you something more
Here we go, here we go, here we go

We can run all night
We can run all night
Running, running, yeah
We can run all night
We can run all night
Running, running, yeah

We can be running all night long
We can be running all night long

I’m waking up my soul to just who it wants to be
I came up through the rough and I changed it
I can’t tame this heart, 'cuz I know I’m living free
Here we go, here we go, here we go

We can run all night
We can run all night
Running, running, yeah
We can run all night
We can run all night
Running, running, yeah

We can be running all night long
We can be running
We can be running all night long
We can be running all night long

Running all night, running all night long
Running all night, running all night
Running all night, running all night long
Running all night, running all night
Running all night, running all night long
Running all night, running all night
Running all night, running all night long
Running all night
Running all night
We've been running

We can run all night, all night
We can run all night, all night
We can run all night, all night
We can be running all night long
We can be running all night long
