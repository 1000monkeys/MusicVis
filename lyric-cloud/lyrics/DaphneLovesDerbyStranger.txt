Darling keep your, keep your voice low
If you can't recall your lines
Maybe they won't, they won't notice
That you're hiding the script
Hiding the script under your sleeves
I'm sure we'll be fine
You've got your friends and I
I've got my makers and all this time
Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay
The critics say the script is old
You step away from the stage and the spotlight
I hold my breath as the curtain comes down
We must have misplaced the scene where love conquers all
It conquers all
And if I could have known on that winter day
That you'd fade away and only I was to blame
I would have stayed awake and found a way
To make every soul in the crowd stand and say
Bittersweet and shame but the ending makes us strong
Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay
The critics say the script is old
Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay
The crowd say the script is old
I'm sure we'll be fine
You've got your friends and I
I've got my makers and all this time
Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay
The critics say the script is old
