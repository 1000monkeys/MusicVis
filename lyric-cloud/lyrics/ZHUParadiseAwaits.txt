I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around, just talking my shit
I'm born with this mighty sin
Thinking about the naked women in my bed

I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around, just talking my shit
Conversations based around just sex
Words at the tip of my tongue
(Oh damn, baby)
I'm born with this mighty sin
Tell me one thing I must forget
Thinking about the naked women in my bed
Lust at the tip of my mind
(Oh damn, baby)

Walking around, just talking my shit

Words at the tip of my tongue

Lust at the tip of my mind

I need to be your lover
I need to be your king

I need to be your lover, I need to be your king
I need to be your lover, everything in between
I need to be your lover, you need to be my queen
Kiss me in my dreams and tell me paradise is what we see

I have seen your face 
(I can see your face, baby)
Kiss me in my dreams 
(I like how you kiss me, baby)
Tell me I'm awake

Paradise awaits

Baby, you wanna touch me
Baby you wanna kiss me

Baby you wanna kiss me
