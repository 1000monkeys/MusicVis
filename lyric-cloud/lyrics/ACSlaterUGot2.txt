King Midas and Leonidas on Islands like Giligan
Serial Killa, Multi Milla, About to Kill again
Mr. Bundy But No the hands in the pants >>
Dancing all the way to the bank doing mah Hammer Dance, UH
2 legit, 2 legit
Making that Nintendo Cash so Wii Fit
And that's word to Mr. Simmons
Richard & Russell on my hustle since the beginning
You in the crosshairs and I'm focused on precision
I'm On my A-Game, A Game like Activision
You on the throwback, throwback like Activator
Lisa, Kelly & Jesse on mah arm I'm AC Slater

You know it's primetime when I hit the switch
We on the frontlines when we hit the switch
Y'all bet it's gametime when I hit the switch
You know it's primetime when I hit the switch
We on the frontlines when we hit the switch
Ya'll bet it's gametime when I hit the switch
HIT THE SWITCH one time
FLIP THE SWITCH one time
HIT IT
HIT IT

HIT IT

I burned it up, burn it up lighter fluid gasoline
Ghoulish, grave diggers, apprehensive for your life like its Halloween
Hating motherfuckers tryna slaughter dreams
Crabs in a bucket is the common theme
Im bold, too cold when i die put my rhymes in a mausoleum
Stop poppin' 'ish, if you can do it better then me stupid you do it
Cools cats we congruent
Not in our league you not fluent
Watch my influence
Niko Da Boss remain the truest
Play the keys, like he moving keys-
Cornerback to the Jet while Revis leaves
Potent that high grade would of thought I marinated in a bag of weed ah
Rhyme faithfully that yellow bus retard flow
They tryna develop a case for me
No court, no files,abort the fees
So hot, I watch heat sweat
Turn ya system up, Killswitch
CHORUS
You know it's primetime when I hit the switch
We on the frontlines when we hit the switch
Y'all bet it's gametime when I hit the switch
You know it's primetime when I hit the switch
We on the frontlines when we hit the switch
Ya'll bet it's gametime when I hit the switch
HIT THE SWITCH one time

It's mah turn and TomTom ain't have to tell me
U got your eyes open wondering who the hell we
Legend of Zelda, killin monsters collecting rupees
Always buy Groupons so you know i got them Groupies
2 Keys, 2 Cars, 2 Houses, 2 Spouses
1 Goal, 1 Mission, 1 Flag, & 1 Mountain
No time for no games, no rules & no losses
Like David, Roger & Bud, we run the game man, we so bossy

Reign supreme, we major league
You Lobby dreams and stay fatigued
I'm well, I'm Madoff
Would believe i was involved In the Ponzi scheme
Cook crack flow for you lazy fiends
Too many hard niggas wearing lady jeans
Staring at your boys wearing Maybeline
I'm just saying, that's how it seems
Bars are body snatchers, Supernatural, gadgetry
Reverent revenge, artistry
Claustrophobic, pardon me
Don't throw darts at me My superstition, super efficient
You need permission, From this commission, you've missed the mission
Left Banks in the Will, I'm Mr. Smithin'
Upperclass Men bout to go the distance
Curse for the thirst has birth the quenching
Can't really say if you birth a christian
Vampire shift stay optimistic
This rap game is a food chain, an ecosystem
Piranha bite, entire systems
Ancestral curse, for all my victims
Dynamite where should we put them
Thanksgiving feast looked like we cooked them
Hell on earth I believe we shook em
Bay Parkway Cemetery where we put them
Take the 2 train, Catch the B6 Take the shit straight down
Oh that's Brooklyn
Now how we looking
Don't be mistook-en, mistaken
Stop hatin' this beat kick like Jamaicans
He Eli and I'm Peyton
