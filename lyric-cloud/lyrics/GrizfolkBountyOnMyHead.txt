I've been waiting for so long
Would you believe me when I said
I've been a fool without your heart?
I must've been misled

Would you love me when I'm gone?
Would you love me when I'm dead?
Would you love me with a bounty on my head?
A bounty on my head?

I've got a really bad feeling I'm gonna love you so good
Take you down to my hometown, my old neighborhood
I've got a really bad feeling you're gonna hurt me so good
I'll go down any way you want, any way I should

No dream comes true
Until you're left hanging by a thread
Until all hope fades away
And blue has turned to red

Would you love me when I'm gone?
Would you love me when I'm dead?
Would you love me with a bounty on my head?
A bounty on my head?

I've got a really bad feeling I'm gonna love you so good
Take you down to my hometown, my old neighborhood
I've got a really bad feeling you're gonna hurt me so good
I'll go down any way you want, any way I should

Alone is what we are
If we are not bleeding
Are we bleeding now? Oh
Alone is what we are
If we are not bleeding
Are we bleeding now?

I've got a really bad feeling I'm gonna love you so good
Take you down to my hometown, my old neighborhood
I've got a really bad feeling you're gonna hurt me so good
I'll go down any way you want
,
 any way I should
