The walls of freedom
Come crumbling down
The moment you put those chains
Around you now
Like liquid poison
It takes it's toll
Black feathered arrows
That pierce your soul

The hate inside
Will eat you alive
The hate inside
Will eat you alive
The hate inside
Will eat you alive
You better not
You better not
Try to keep it
You better not
Better not
Try to keep
The hate inside

This furyâ€™s burning
Inside your chest
It steals the air out from your breath

The hate inside
Will eat you alive
The hate inside
Will eat you alive
The hate inside
Will eat you alive
You better not
You better not
Try to keep it
You better not
Better not
Try to keep
The hate inside

The hate inside
The hate inside
The hate inside
The hate inside
The hate inside
The hate inside
The hate inside
The hate inside
Will eat you alive
