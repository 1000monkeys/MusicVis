She's tired of thinking till the sun comes up
Her body aches when she's awake
It kills her mother when she drinks too much
She can't stay sober for a day
She's giving everything to numb the burns
Addicted to the losing fight
She looks vacant but the wheels still turn
She could be singing this tonight

I wanna touch the northern lights
We could leave the world behind
I wanna know what it's like
To walk away from this life

I have to cross entire oceans when
I want a moment of her time
She never wants to fall in love again
And every kiss would be a crime
Maybe she suffers for the thrill of it all
But I know she's thinking when she falls

I wanna touch the northern lights
We could leave the world behind
I wanna know what it's like
To walk away from this life

And maybe one day
When I've suffered
Tired and twisted
I'll call her
And we'll drive
Into the sunset
Into the sunset

I wanna touch the northern lights
We could leave the world behind
I wanna know what it's like
To walk away from this life
I wanna touch the northern lights
We could leave the world behind
I wanna know what it's like
To walk away from this life
