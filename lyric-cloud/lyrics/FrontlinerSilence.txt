These are the pictures
These are the feelings from the frontline
Living in silence
Feeling the deafness like heavy smoke
Smiling with strangers
Counting the days
Like a spring coiled up inside
Welcome to your future
Welcome to your book of lies

Fingers crawl through pages
Nothing changes living here

Inertia, no wish to move at all
Inertia, everything's a stone wall
Inertia, history lets you die

A raged pile of silent accusers
Smell the blood of strangers here
No eyes, no ears, no smell, no taste
The mouth of the maggot is
Full of this place

Murdered conscience
The pressure is crushing heads
Like paper lanterns now
Unbreakable grip, a dead hand
Driving us forward to the end

Kicking through the traces
A thousand years from now

Inertia, no wish to think at all
Inertia, everything's a stone wall
Inertia, history lets you die

Inertia, no wish to move at all
Inertia, everything's a stone wall
Inertia, history lets you die
