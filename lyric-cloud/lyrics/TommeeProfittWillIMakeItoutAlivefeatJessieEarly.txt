The world is up in arms
All the pieces falling apart
Gotta get out while you can
Gotta get out while you can
The drums inside my chest
Just can't seem to catch a breath
Gotta get out while you can
Gotta get out while you can
Am I gonna swim, am I gonna sink?
Am I gonna bend, am I gonna break?
Will I make it out alive?
Make it out alive?
Am I gonna fly, am I gonna fall?
Am I gonna live, gonna lose it all?
Will I make it out alive?
Make it out alive?
The pressure is weighing down
Is closing in all around
Gotta get out while you can
Gotta get out while you can!
Am I gonna swim, am I gonna sink?
Am I gonna bend, am I gonna break?
Will I make it out alive?
Make it out alive?
Am I gonna fly, am I gonna fall?
Am I gonna live, gonna lose it all?
But will I make it out alive?
Make it out alive?
Am I gonna swim, am I gonna sink?
Am I gonna bend, am I gonna break?
Will I make it out alive?
Make it out alive?
