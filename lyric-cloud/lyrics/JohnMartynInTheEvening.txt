The Lord hath appointed him an inheritance upon the land of Zion. Yea, and his head shall blossom And he shall be as an olive branch that is bowed down with fruit: even so; Amen. And again, blessed be brother Sidney, also notwithstanding he shall be high and lifted up, yet he shall bow down under the yoke like unto an ass that coucheth beneath his burthen; that learneth his master's will by the stroke of the rod: thus saith the Lord. Yet the Lord will have mercy on him, and he shall bring forth much fruit; even as the vun vine of the choice grape when her clusters are is ripe, before the time of the gleaning of the vintage: and the Lord shall make his heart merry as with sweet wine because of him who putteth forth his hand and lifteth him up from out of  deep mire, and pointeth him out the way, and guideth his feet when he stumbles; and humbleth him in his pride. Blessed are his generations. Nevertheless, one shall hunt after them as a man hunteth after an ass that hath strayed in the wilderness, & straitway findeth him and bringeth him into the fold. Thus shall the Lord watch over his generation that they may be saved: even so; Amen. / on the 13th and 14th days of October  I baptised the following person in Mount Pleasant viz Moses Chapman Nickerson

/ January 11, 1834.
This evening Joseph Smith Jr, Frederick G. Williams, Newel K. Whitney, John Johnson, Oliver Cowdery, and Orson Hyd united in prayer and asked the Lord to grant the following petition: Firstly, That the Lord would grant that our lives might be precious in his sight, that he would watch over our persons and give his angels charge concerning us and our families that no evil nor unseen hand might be permitted to harm us. Secondly, That the Lord would also hold the lives of all the United firm, and not suffer that any of them shall be taken. Thirdly, That the Lord would grant that our brother Joseph might prevail over his enemy, even Docter P. Hurlbut, who has threatened his life, whom brother Joseph has caused to be taken with a precept; that the Lord would fill the heart of the court with a spirit to do justice, and cause that the law of the land may be magnified in bringing him to justice. Fourthly, That the Lord would provide, in the order of his Providence, the bishop of this church with means sufficient to discharge every debt that the Firm owes, in due season, that the Church may not be braught into disrepute, and the saints be afflicted by the hands of their enemies. Fifthly, That the Lord would protect our printing press from the hands of evil men, and give us means to send forth his word, even his gospel that the ey ears of all may hear it, and also that we may print his scriptures, and also that he would give those who were appointed to conduct the press, wisdom sufficient that the cause may not be hindered, but that men's eyes may thereby be opened to see the truth. Sixthly, That the Lord would deliver Zion, and gather in his scattered people, to possess it in peace; and also, while in their dispersion, that he would provide for them that they perish not with hunger nor fam cold. And finally, that God in the name of Jesus would gather his elect speedily, and unveil his face that his saints might behold his glory and dwell with him; Amen. On the 13th of March A. D. 1833, Docter P. Hurlbut came to my house; I conversed with him considerably about the book of Mormon. He was ordained to the office of an elder in this Church under the hand of Sidney Rigdon on the 18th of March in the same year above written. According to my best recollection, I heard him say, in the course of conversing with him, that if he ever became convinced that the book of Mormon was false, he would be the cause of my destruction, &c. He was tried before a counsel of high priests on the 21st day of June, 1833, and his license restored to him again, it he previously having been taken by the church at cut off from the Church by the bishop's court. He was finally cut off from the church a few days after having his license restored, on the 21st of June. / and then saught the distruction of the saints in this place and more particularly myself and family and as the Lord has in his mercy Delivered me out of his hand till the present and also the church that he has not prevailed viz the 28 day of Jany 1834 for which I off the gratitud of my heart to Allmighty God for the same and on this night Bro Oliv and bro Frederick and my self bowed before the Lord being agred and united in pray that God would continue to deliver me and my brethren from him that he may not prevail again us in the law suit that is pending and also that God would soften down the hearts of E Smith J Jones Lowd  &  Lyman and also  Bardsly that they might obey the gospel or if they would not repent that the Lord would send faithful saints to purchase their farms that this stake may be strengthened and its the borders enlarged O Lord grant it for Christ Sake Amen

After resting a while, we left, and soon arrived at brother Johnathan Tayler's , in Norton, where we were received with kindness. We soon retired to the wilderness where we united in prayer and suplication for the blessings of the Lord to be given unto his church: We called upon the Father in the name of Jesus to go with the brethen who were going up to the land of Zion, to give brother Joseph strength, and wisdom, and understanding sufficient to lead the people of the Lord, and to gather back and establish the saints upon the land of their inheritances, and organize them according to the will of heaven, that they be no more cast down forever. We then united and laid on hands: Brothers Sidney, Oliver, and Zebedee  laid hands upon bro. Joseph, and confirmed upon him all the blessings necessary to qualify him to do stand before the Lord in his high calling; and he return again in peace and triumph, to enjoy the society of his brethen. Brothers Joseph, Sidney, and Zebedee then laid hands upon bro. Oliver, and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and understanding sufficient for his station; that he be qualified to assist brother Sidney in arranging the church covenants which are to be soon published; and to have intelligence in all things to do the work of printing. Brother Joseph, Oliver, Zebedee then laid hands upon bro. Sidney, and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and knowledge to preside over the Church in the abscence of brother Joseph, and to have the spirit to assist bro. Oliver in conducting the Star, and to arrange the Church covenants, and the blessing of old age and peace, till Zion is built up & Kirtland established, till all his enemies are under his feet, and of a crown of eternal life at the in the Kingdom of God with us. We, Joseph, Sidney, and Oliver then laid hands upon bro. Zebedee, and confirmed the blessing of wisdom to preach the gospel, even till it spreads to the islands of the sea, and to be spared to see three score years and ten, and see Zion built up and Kirtland established forever, and even at last to receive a crown of life. Our hearts rejoiced, and we were comforted with the Holy Spirit, Amen.

This evening Joseph and Oliver united in prayer for the continuance of blessings, after giving thanks for the relief which the Lord had lately sent us by opening the hearts of certain brethren from the east to loan us $430. After conversing and rejoicing before the Lord on this occasion we agreed to enter into the following covenant with the Lord, viz: That if the Lord will prosper us in our business, and open the way before us that we may obtain means to pay our debts, that we be not troubled nor brought into disrepute before the world nor his people, that after that of all that he shall give us we will give a tenth, to be bestowed upon the poor in his Church, or as he shall command, and that we will be faithful over that which he has entrusted to our care and that we may obtain much: and that our children after us shall remember to observe this sacred and holy covenant: after us. And that our children and our children’s  may know of the same we here subscribe our names with our own hands before the Lord: Joseph Smith Jr /Oliver Cowdery. And now, O Father, as thou didst prosper our father Jacob, and bless him with protection and prosperity where ever he went from the time he made a like covenant before and with thee; and as thou didst, even the same night, open the heavens unto him and manifest great mercy and favor, and give him promises, so wilt thou do by us his sons; and as his blessings prevailed above the blessings of his Progenitors unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, even so may our blessings prevail above like his; and may thy servants be preserved from the power and influence of wicked and unrighteous men; may every weapon formed against us fall upon the head of him who shall form it; may we be blessed with a name and a place among thy saints here, and thy sanctified when they shall rest. Amen.
