Yeah, get the fuck out my face
I cannot feel my face
I don't want time, just face
Put it all on her face
Get the fuck out my face
I cannot feel my face
I don't want time, just face
Put it all on her face

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young

I been getting lit
Since eleven years old, bitch
Go ahead, call the cops
I'm on the roof, in my fucking socks
I got a bitch in a halter top
Don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
Bounce that ass all on me crazy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Smack that, five rings on like Brady (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just pulled up to the red carpet
Drugs in every single pocket (uh)

Get the fuck out my face
I cannot feel my face
I don't want time, just face
Put it all on her face
Get the fuck out my face
I cannot feel my face
I don't want time, just face
Put it all on her face

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young

I ain't gonna stop getting high
I ain't gonna stop getting high
I ain't never even goin' try
Even though I almost died
But I didn't, I am alive (ha)
I ain't gonna stop getting high
I ain't gonna stop getting high
I ain't never even goin' try
I ain't even gonna front
Hurry up and pass the blunt, gun

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, live fast die young

Get the fuck out of my face!
Yeah head on no backin' down
Can't play around
Did a lot of shit in my past
Fuck that, look at me now
Head on no backin' down
No playin' around
Did a lot of shit in my past
Fuck that, look at me now
It's been a long time coming now
Fuck that, look at me now
It's been a long time coming now
It's been a long time coming now
It's been a long time coming now
Fuck that, look at me now
I wear the crown
