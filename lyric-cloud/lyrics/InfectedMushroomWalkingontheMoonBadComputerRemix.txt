Walking on the moon
Walking on the moon
Take one moment to escape
It will change your mood
When you're walking on the moon
Walking on the moon, walking on the moon
This is how I feel
When you take me to some places that I've never been
That I've never ever never ev- e- e- ever ever
Ever ever ever never been
Whеn we dance again
All our trouble seems to fadе away
This is how I feel
When you take me to some levels that I've never been
(That I've never ever never ev- e- e- ever ever)
All our trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
When you take me to some places that I've never been
That I've never been
That I've never ever never ev- e- e- ever ever
Ever ever ever never been
That I've never been
That I've never ever never ev- e- e- ever ever
