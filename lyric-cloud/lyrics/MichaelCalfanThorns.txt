Cut so deep
I caught these demons living under me
So don't pick me
I'm like a rose only close you'll see

I got these thorns, thorns, thorns
I got these thorns, thorns, thorns
I got these thorns, thorns, thorns

I got these 
(thorns, thorns, thorns)
I got these 
(thorns, thorns, thorns)
I got these

Walk with me
Into the darkness in the evergreen
And we'll be free
When we see that there's beauty in the ugly

I got these thorns, thorns, thorns
I got these thorns, thorns, thorns
In under me

I got these 
(thorns, thorns, thorns)
I got these 
(thorns, thorns, thorns)
I got these
