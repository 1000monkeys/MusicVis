This forest
Is growing faster than I can tell
Cell structure
Eats away at a massive swell
Seems however
I'm a victim of circumstance
Hunt for
Ogres and Dwarfs
Lion-slicer

Run
With
Death
Run
With
Death

White faces
Coming closer with every step
Earth envelopes
Taking breath without happenstance
Carve my teeth out
Ripping through the sheep's head curse
Hunter
Gatherer
Ridden from the cave

Run
With
Death
Run
With
Death

Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taken everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now

Run
With
Death
Run
With
Death

Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taken everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now
