Pocket full of posies
In the light
Take this as a token
In disguise
Cotton candy roses
Won't make you mi-i-ine
Beggars can't be chosen
Everybody knows it
Pocket full of...

I get it
I'm supposed to be your fantasy
You want it
I'm runnin' out of energy
Oh inferno
In my lungs (in my lungs)
Somehow they turn to words we keep
Used to argue till their lullabies
Oh please
Sleep on it
I'm just a one trick pony (Ba ba, ba da ba da)
If all it takes to hold me
Is tell the world my story (Ba ba, ba da ba da ba)
I'm sorry
I don't have to be, no (I don't have to be, no)
Think I cracked the geno-ome (Ba ba, ba da ba da ba)
Long as I am runnin'
Home with...

Pocket full of posies
In...
(Ba ba, ba da ba da)
(Ba ba, ba da ba da)
...roses
Won't make you mi-i-ine (Ba ba, ba da da da)
Beggars can't be chosen
Everybody knows it
Pocket full of...

(Oh, da da, da la da da)
Charade, charade
(Oh, da da, da la da da)
A masquerade
(Oh, da da, da la da da)
Charade, charade
(Oh, da da, da la da da)
A masquerade
