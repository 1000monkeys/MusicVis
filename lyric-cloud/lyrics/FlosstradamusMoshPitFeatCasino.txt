I woke up this morning on my money shit
Grab my sack, hit the streets, I'm on some other shit
My girl out of town, I'm with my other bitch
Hit the mall, blew it all on a bunch of shit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit!

I hit the mall and bought a whole bunch of Louis shit
But I already got on a whole bunch of Gucci shit
And then I told you about my other bitch
She started tripping and I went and got my other bitch
Now I turnt up in the club on some boss shit
I done turned the whole club to a mosh pit
Got bad bitches flying everywhere
Got people flying everywhere
Now bottles flying everywhere

I woke up this morning' on my money shit
Grab my sack, hit the streets, I'm on some other shit
My girl out of town, I'm with my other bitch
Hit the mall, blew it all on a bunch of shit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit!

Check out the studio, on my Floss shit
Big chain, bet you wonder what it cost, bitch
Now go crazy in this motherfucker, straight sick
Now everybody freeze, Instagram pic
Now everybody scream, Casino been rich
And move 'em out the way, if they on some hate shit
Now move with me 'ay 'ay, on that wild shit
That young nigga jumping in a crowd shit

I woke up this morning on my money shit
Grab my sack, hit the streets, I'm on some other shit
My girl out of town, I'm with my other bitch
Hit the mall, blew it all on a bunch of shit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit
Then hit the club and turn the crowd to a mosh pit!
