Hold on to the moment
When there's something brewing in the sky
Come on, there's too much distance
Separating you and I
But there's no real reason
Take what you can get, she's never asking why
Now, I know, that's treason
I'm shaking and moving and it's all because of you

And I feel something
What you feel boy, the heat
Oh, I feel something
What you feel boy, the beat

Break in
To the system
These walls between us are just way too high
Bend light
In a prism
Seven colors flashing in your eyes
You must try
To escape it
Boy, you'll never ever see the lie
If you buy
My Story
I'll take you and I'll move you
And I hope you think it's true

And I feel something
What you feel boy, the heat
Oh, I feel something
What you feel boy, the beat
And I feel something
What you feel boy, the heat
Oh, I feel something
What you feel boy, the beat


And I feel something
What you feel boy, the heat
Oh, I feel something
What you feel boy, the beat
And I feel something
What you feel boy, the heat
Oh, I feel something
What you feel boy, the beat
