These days nothing ever feels like home
You say you're driving down a one way road
If you see the day only for the night
Do you see the darkness in the middle of the light?
Feel your heart break
You're not the only one you know

When you find yourself, all on your own
You'll never walk alone
In the dead of the night, out in the cold
You'll never walk alone

You'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
