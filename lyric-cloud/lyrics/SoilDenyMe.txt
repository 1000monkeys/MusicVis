Tell me does your pride bleed
When you see me succeed?
Is that the gist of your story?
Now you had best get used to it
'Cause I ain't about to quit
And I'm just now getting started
Shame me, claim me, or deceive me
You grow sick every time you hear me say "Believe Me"
Every time I get one foot up
You want to tear it down
You deny me, deceiver
Every time I get one foot up
You tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer, deny me
I feel your hand on my throat
As well as the knife in my back
And the whole time you keep smiling
What is your reason for this?
Why won't your hate just quit?
Life would be better if you weren't struggling
Shame me, claim me, or deceive me
You grow sick every time you hear me say "Believe Me"
Every time I get one foot up
You want to tear it down
You deny me, deceiver
Every time I get one foot up
You tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer, deny me
What's wrong with your world?
Doesn't taste the same as mine
Aren't the shades the same as mine?
Pain, Agony, Regret, Fear
Just dreams whisked away, taken away
So now does your pride still bleed
Every time that I succeed?
Now that you know I'll keep trying
Can your weak mind digest
All that I'm feeding it?
Every time I get one foot up
You want to tear it down
You deny me, deceiver
Every time I get one foot up
You tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer, deny me
Every time I get one foot up, up, up, whoa
You deny me, deceiver
Every time I get one foot up
You tear it down, knock it down, tear it down
Believer, deny me
