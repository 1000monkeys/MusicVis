Like a bird with no song
I've been silent so long
I've been hiding my love
I've been hiding
Like a bird with no song
I've been silent so long
I've been hiding my love
I've been hiding
Hiding
Hiding
But I'd change my tune, if it works for you
I would flip the switch into something new
I would change it all
I would change it all
But I'd change my tune, if it works for you
I would flip the switch into something new
I would change it all
I would change it all
Like a bird with no song
I've been silent so long
I've been hiding my love
I've been hiding
Like a bird with no song
I've been silent so long
I've been hiding my love
I've been hiding
Hiding
Hiding
But I'd change my tune, if it works for you
I would flip the switch into something new
I would change it all
I would change it all
But I'd change my tune, if it works for you
I would flip the switch into something new
I would change it all
I would change it all
