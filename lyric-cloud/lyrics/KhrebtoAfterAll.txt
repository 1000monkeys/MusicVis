We'll be back on the ceiling
I've been stumbling around, figuring out
How to get what I'm missing
I'll shoot for the moon, won't give up too soon

I've been your valentine
For so long
I was all yours and you were mine
For so long
Don't any stars have died?
No, no
And we can still see them shine

After all
After all
After all

And I hope that you hear me
It's been crazy these years but I felt the fears
And now I hope it's not too late
Shoot for the moon, don't give up too soon

I've been your valentine
For so long
I was all yours and you were mine
For so long
Don't any stars have died?
No, no
And we can still see them shine

After all
After all
After all

Lightyears passing by
Oh, you're still on my mind 
You're all I am longing for at night
It's so hard to believe that you're gone when you still shine

After all
After all
After all
