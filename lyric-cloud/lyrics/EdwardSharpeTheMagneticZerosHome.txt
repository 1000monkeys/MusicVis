[Verse 1: Jade & 
Alexander
]
Alabama, Arkansas, 
I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you
Well, Holy moly, me oh my, you're 
the apple of my eye
Girl, I never loved one like you
Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie, chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Oh, 
home
, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la, take me home
Honey (Mother), I'm coming home
[Verse 2: Jade & 
Alexander
 & 
both
]
I'll follow you into the park, through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls
I been everywhere with you 
(that's true)
Laugh until we think 
we'll die,
 barefoot on a 
summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree, like it's only 
you and me
Geeze, you're something to see

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home
[Bridge: Jade & 
Alexander
 (spoken)]
Jade?
Alexander?
Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
I sure do â€’ you came jumping out after me!
Well, you fell on the concrete and nearly broke you ass, and you were bleeding all over the place, and I rushed you out to the hospital. You remember that?
Yes, I do
Well there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you 'til just now!
Aww!

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is where I'm alone with you
[Outro: Jade & 
Alexander
]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, yes I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls
(Oh home)
 Home
(Oh home)
 Home
Home is wherever I'm with you
(Oh home)
 Home
(Oh home)
 Home
Home is when I'm alone with you
