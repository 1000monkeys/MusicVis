 x4
On Mamas, uh
On Citas, On Mamas
Niggas talk but they don't want problems

Your life past 'fore your ass even touched the grass
211 in progress, no ski mask
Assholes to Elbows, lay down and kiss Satan
Thats a weakness nigga hatin
I'm out here motivatin
On bitas, Citas, thats my word
So jump back off the porch, pop back on the curb
Breakin down some herb
Gettin ready for the twistback
4 or 5 grams need a titan just to twist that
Niggas talk but they don't want none of that
On Citas from the top got right back
Droppin back in the pocket bout to hit sum
And no frontin', let me tell you bullshits nothin'
Puttin' hoes in the war room
My moves mean team militant, it's straight goon
Head bluntin' puttin' hoes in the war room
My moves mean team militant its straight goon


Hella proper
Hella chopper
Thats hella fly, tell the doctor
Im the man, thats how I ride around like
I'm the whole thing, you a sound bite
Got the city on, whole bay too
Hella bad ones fallin outta H2
Get money then they hate you
Turn around, say they made you
Well hate this then
We some young niggas ballin like Pistons
Gettin love ain't no where a nigga can't go
Ten racks same show im getting Pesos
Like woop, woop, thats cookin
Paid 200 for the mookies
Hear a beat take a dukie
And the all black whip lookin spooky


They don't want problems
They don't want problems
Actin like they gangsta, but they don't want drama
Boy they be quiet, when you pull that llama
Put that on my Citas, and my grandmamas
Return of the skitzo
Maniac, flip so
That boy go yeye
He party like a disco
And diss go, go, go, gone
They been waitin for the boy Fabby just to bring it home
So them niggas been tryna turn up, but they was doin it wrong
I was off for a minute but im right back on
Yeah right back on
Yup on in the middle of it
I don't give a finger in the middle of it
Nigga yellin fuck em, fuck em
They was hatin on me
But shoutout to the real niggas waitin on me
Don't gotta bring it back cause it ain't never left
It's Suzy on the track nigga rare yup


(2ND PART OF SONG)
Yeah, yeah (Take it down)
Uh, yeah (x2) (Take it down) (x2)
(BRING IT BACK DOWN TO EARTH!)

Uh, plant twist
Hipster girls get vanquished
Eatin' rappers treating labels like Banquest
Ready to dominate, homie i'm anxious
Bring it back down to earth with me, recognize the uncertainty
Of a career in music but i still handle it perfectly
Reflecting the greats, deflecting the hate
Accepting the challenge, i spit in they face
I reiterate the lessons that i was taught
As a youth, respect me like the truth, uh
Smoking fruit giving weak hoes the boot
Keep the money on line being broke don't compute with me
I'm in love with yo mind, never try to be cute with me
Too busy writing rhymes, rather spend time producing beats
& making this money don't try to take it from me, or it's..
Hell on earth, know exactly what i'm worth
Keep it real with my homies until i'm under the dirt
Saving hoes ain't my 'bidness, i leave that there for the church!
Lookin' for the real you couldn't just search
Cause me & my gang finna
(BRING IT BACK DOWN TO EARTH!)

All i need is high hat and kick
Niggas salty in they spirit, Top Ramen and shit
I set a goal and my intentions are accomplishing it
I'm tired of hearing about my niggas dying and shit
I'm tryna get rich, i need it like vaginas & dick
It's serious shit, this assholes serious shit
They say the, harder the crime, the more time that you get
But i just see me city hurting, close my eyes and just spit

Get a new phone write the whole verse on the plane
Flight chain bright, want it bet i could get it the same
Night game tight, i ain't doing your work, it's about time
I show these niggas what hard work is

You see i like to have my cake and i eat it too
Electric feel, can i get a little Pikachu
A bit poppy, seed of a monster, mantra
Hesitate they'll love you right contra
Cost a thang, and i'll blang till yo eye's close
And my eye's low, smoking on God knows
But is you feelin it? Knowing that you feelin it
And i'm dealin' it, promise that i'm real in it
Yo boy is in the building like a blueprint
HBK, we open windows till the roof bent
Tryna dodge Lu-ci-fer in a coup that purrs, bubble up in a suit
That stirs (BRING IT BACK DOWN TO EARTH!)
I'm, sick of these other niggas stealin' my flows
Either you with me or against me, and i'm killing my foes
I'm still in my clothes, gettin' it, look at who's spittin'
I mean your girl you kick it with is feelin' my bro's
I wanna sit back, kid back, maybe we can chit-chat
Tryna get with home girl? We already hit that
Like a verb i show you what it do, imma do it just to show you
We can do it too!

?? is living proof
My homies laced up like tennis shoes
Climbed my way from Toyotas to Bentley coups
Homies say i got the Juice
Confidence boost up through the roof, tell me what's the use?
Use my juice to inspired youth, HUUUH!

I'm fucking with girls with, insecurities & they
All love Beyonc√©, they love to parody
& and it's kinda hard to be sucka free with double D's
But i still love her, as we fill rubbers
And uh, i think i'm high... i might be not
??? Prince, nike socks, wavy hair, windy locs, chandelier
Diamond guap, take me there, send me ??, get me faded
Lightly washed

It's ???
Gas all tank
Wear bank
Shock can't block this paint
Pics last mornin', take a couple for your lookbook
Imma good crook, "sorry" ain't a good look

Never apologize, that's the bitch talking in you
Me & my niggas ride on a sick instrumental
Ain't shit accidental, put curtains around the windows
When all of my niggas assemble we murderin' shit!
(BRING IT BACK DOWN TO EARTH!)
(Take it down) (x3)
(BRING IT BACK DOWN TO EARTH!)
