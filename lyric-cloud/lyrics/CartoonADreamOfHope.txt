A boy has to desire an ambition, and with a dream, the wide world which seems so distant, is now right within his reach, all his anxiety and despair make way for ease and encouragement, the boy doesn’t always know, but at some point, he believes

They are dreamers
Wide-eyed from the whimsical thoughts of fantasies to escape the arena of life
A battlefield, every second’s a fight
Penetrating the night, his spirit’s a vigorous light
She wanted happiness, is that too much to ask?
Why he so positive? Is it just a mask that hides the immense pain? Emotionally strained
Tryna maintain until the world change
Anime’s his escape, bedsheet as a cape
Fly away from this place of disgrace
Backpacks his briefcase with dreams in it
Reclusive exclusive though she seems timid, it ain’t that
It’s just most wouldn’t understand his state of mind
Imaginary lands she crafts at a glance, drawing pictures in the sand
Time waits for no man, it’s unplanned
So most of his time, he spends it on dreams of the wonderful things
In his world, he’s a king
So most of her time, she spends it on dreams of the wonderful things
In her world, she’s a queen

Bliss or misery, she is met with a path and must make a choice, when this happens, she realizes the emotion of fear makes way for imagination and magic

So they dream ’til the sunshine, while the moon glows
Mesmerized by them same cartoon shows
But he knows and
She knows so
Keep dreaming
Move so
God, dream until the sunshine, while the moon glows
Mesmerized by them same cartoon shows
But he knows and
She knows so
Keep dreaming
Move so

Keep dreaming
The stars look so beautiful this evening
But tonight they won’t sleep
Too busy visualizing how life can be with unity and peace
Emphasizing the glorious horizon in his eyes and hers too
The real world will hurt you with no alert too
You’ll never take away our right to dream and believe
There’s more to this world we have yet to perceive

In Japan they call it , in Spanish soñador
Everything that she was going for, every open door that closed at the very moment she approached it, but it gets out of her focus with doubt, remains a powerful opponent
And she knows it
Just a “different strokes for different folks”
Some aspire to get on, some just coast
Not to boast
Some just sit online and post, ask me, “What’s the use of hope?”
Some are dreamers and achievers
Get you one who can do both
In the glow of the moonlight
 caterpillar grow in your new life
Rise up and go and float like a balloon fly
Don’t worry, you can never shine too bright, if you believe yeah
So most of his time, he spends it on dreams of the wonderful things
In his world, he’s a king
So most of her time, she spends it on dreams of the wonderful things
In her world, she’s a queen

So they dream ’til the sunshine, while the moon glows
Mesmerized by them same cartoon shows
But he knows and
She knows so
Keep dreaming
Move so
God, dream until the sunshine, while the moon glows
Mesmerized by them same cartoon shows
But he knows and
She knows so
Keep dreaming
Move so
So most of his time, he spends it on dreams
So most of her time, she spends it on dreams
