I reach for the phone, I don't know who to call
That excites me
Starving for days, I've been told it's a phase
But they don't see
That I've been holding on to something that I just can't seem to catch
And now I've been following this dream so long
But nothing never lasts

Oh, but I like it
Won't try to fight it
Oh, no, no, that's me

Under untouched sheets, hands I like to feel all on me, tonight
As I fall asleep, you're a vivid dream
But you're never real, a lie
Sometimes I wake up alone
Wake up alone
I like to wake up alone
In the night

In the night
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night (alone)
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night, (in the night)
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night, (in the night)

I go catch a movie, and once in a while
Sit there in silence, I laugh and I cry
There ain't enough time or days in a week
That excites me
'Cause I've been holding onto something that I just can't seem to catch
Now I've been following this dream so long
But nothing never lasts

Oh, but I like it
Won't try to fight it
Oh, no, no, that's me

Under untouched sheets, hands I like to feel all on me, tonight
As I fall asleep, you're a vivid dream
But you're never real, a lie
Sometimes I wake up alone
Wake up alone
I like to wake up alone
In the night
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
I like to wake up alone
In the night

In the night
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night (alone)
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night, (in the night)
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night
In the night, night
In the night
In the night, night, (in the night)

In the night
