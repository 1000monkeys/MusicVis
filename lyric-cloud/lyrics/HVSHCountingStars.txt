Man, I don’t get that
Get what?
That texting shit
And what’s wrong with texting?
You mean, aside from the fact that it’s the stupidest fuckin’ thing in the world
I mean, why would anyone in they right minds spend fifteen minutes, tryna type some shit
They could’ve called and said in five seconds?
Plus, it involves typing with your thumbs, which I just don’t approve of

I’m coming for the top ranks
With my gang, smellin’ dank
Y’all niggas weeners, but weak franks
Pull shit like a tweezer, I’mma push with the shank
Think like I can’t
I trust my sofa ‘fore I fuck with a bank
Almost drowned when I was eight, nigga, I could’ve sank
Multiple concussions, surprised I’m not scared to blink
Grim Reaper gave me too many winks
I couldn’t die if I tried
Yeah, the devil is a lie
I’mma divide the pie
If I’m wrong, I’mma make a noose with my tie
Everybody getting fed before I say, “Bye”
Tell them that Yeezus made me want to touch the sky
Now, I’m counting stars instead of sheep, no lullabies
Hush, lil’ baby, don’t you cry, we all fly
The Creator made me find my wings, now, I’m way too high
Oh, me, oh, my-my, no small fry
Come through nonchalant, but still, “Who that guy?”
It’s GRIM D with the twinkle in my eyes
AKUMA GANG shining through the rain with a BackWood for the pain
Mic with a lil’ bit a gain
I remember when I was twelve, wishing money never existed
How you killing people with the same pigment?
When I say, “M-O-E”, I better D-I-E
In a deep-ass sea with concrete shoes on my feet
Never kick up dirt with my cleets

I float on the beat
No camouflage, just call me mystique
Never admitting defeat
Coming strong with the fleet
Coming strong with the fleet
Yeah, I float on the beat
No camouflage, just call me mystique
Never admitting defeat
Coming strong with the fleet

Yeah, uh
Coming strong with the fleet
Ah, uh
Coming strong with the fleet
Ah, yeah
Coming strong with the fleet
Yeah, I rep CT
Nigga, fuck do you mean?
