I'd like to meet you honey
Oh, I could be a good time
You like how I treat you honey?
I've got a few things in mind

So what can I do?
What can I do?
Oh, what can I do?
What can I do?
What can I do to get closer to you?
What can I do?

You know how to please me
You make it so easy
Like taking candy from a baby
Whenever I see you
I know how to read you
Like taking candy from a baby

I like how you need me, honey
Ever since you opened that door
And I love how you see me
I help myself until there's nothing more

So what can I do?
What can I do?
Oh, what can I do?
What can I do?
What can I do to get closer to you?
What can I do?

You know how to please me
You make it so easy
Like taking candy from a baby
Whenever I see you
I know how to read you
Like taking candy from a baby

What can I do?
Tell me, tell me
What can I do?
What can I do to get closer to you?
What can I do?

You know how to please me
You make it so easy
Like taking candy from a baby
Whenever I see you
I know how to read you
Like taking candy from a baby
