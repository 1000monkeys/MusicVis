Home, never too far, never too close to come home
Never too lost, never too found to come home
Never too young, never too old to be known
No matter how far you go, you're never alone

We can believe in
We can believe in dreams

Oh, life will knock you down more times than you can count
So don't spend your time just trying to get yourself down
Or looking for yourself when you're already found
Home will always be waiting when you come around

We can believe in
We can believe in dreams
Can you hear them? Can you hear them?
Can you hear these dreams?
Calling out your name, can you hear them?
Can you hear these dreams?
