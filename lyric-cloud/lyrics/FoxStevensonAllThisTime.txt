I don't mind
'Cause this is something that I have to find
After all this time, I'll be okay
'Cause when the skies turn black
And the floor beneath me starts to crack
You know I'm coming back today
You know I'm coming back today

I don't mind
'Cause this is something that I have to find
After all this time, I'll be okay
'Cause when the skies turn black
And the floor beneath me starts to crack
You know I'm coming back today

I know that it's too hard to find
A little peace of mind in this crazy storm
So we'll go wherever we feel like
'Cause I'm that kind of guy
You've been warned

Well, as a last resort
We're gonna give it one more try
We'll give it one more shot, and one more go
And it'll be all for naught
If after all this time
We've given all we've got and still don't know

I don't mind
'Cause this is something that I have to find
After all this time, I'll be okay
'Cause when the skies turn black
And the floor beneath me starts to crack
You know I'm coming back today
