(Waiting for the rain)
(I'm not holding back for anyone)
(Waiting for the rain)
(I'm not holding back for anyone)

I've been holding on forever
Waiting for the rain to come
Who am I to just surrender
I'm not holding back for anyone

I've been holding on forever
Waiting for the rain to come
Who am I to just surrender
I'm not holding back for anyone

I'm not holding back for anyone
Waiting for the rain to come
I'm not holding back for anyone
Waiting for the rain to come

I'm not holding back for anyone
(I'm not holding back for anyone)
(Waiting for the rain to come)
(I'm not holding back for anyone)

I've been holding on forever
Waiting for the rain to come
Who am I to just surrender
I'm not holding back for anyone

I've been holding on forever
Waiting for the rain to come
Who am I to just surrender
I'm not holding back for anyone
(Anyone, anyone)
I'm not holding back for anyone

I'm not holding back for anyone
Waiting for the rain to come
I'm not holding back for anyone
Waiting for the rain to come
I'm not holding back for anyone
