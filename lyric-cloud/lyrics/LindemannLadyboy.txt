Black lips, brown eyes
Wet flesh, good size
So hot, when it crawls
I burn for dicks and holes

Ladyboy
Ladyboy
He is my toy boy
My ladyboy
Ladyboy

Just for fun, no romance
Two in one, I'll take my chance
All you can eat it's hot as coals
I drown in meat in dicks and holes

Ladyboy
Ladyboy, ja
He is my toy boy
My ladyboy
Ladyboy

I got shot with the sweetest gun
I have it all, all in one
No broken hearts, no bad romance
Why should I love when I can have fun
With my ladyboy
I got shot with the sweetest gun
Never mind what I have become
Why should I love when I can have fun
With my breathing toy

Ladyboy, ja!
Ladyboy
She is my toy boy
My ladyboy

I got shot with the sweetest gun
I have it all, all in one
No broken hearts, no bad romance
Why should I love when I can have fun
With my ladyboy, hahahahaha
