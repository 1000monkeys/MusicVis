I love the way you leave me with a taste on my tongue
I like the way you whisper when you tell me you love me
I swear that I can give you every breath in my lungs, yeah
As long as you can promise that you'll be here to hold me

Oh, I can't wait to fall into this web you've spun
No, I don't wanna get back up
Just keep me now

So my summer love, keep me high
I'm all alone, won't ya stay a while
Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world, just you and I
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world, just you and I

I love the way you hold me with the words that you say
You're the only one that lifts me when there's no one around
It may not last forever but I guess it's okay, yeah
As long as you can love me just one last time

Oh, I can't wait to fall into this web you've spun (Just can't wait)
No, I don't wanna get back up
Just keep me now

So my summer love, keep me high
I'm all alone, won't ya stay a while
Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world, just you and I
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world, just you and I

Just k-, ooh (Yeah)
Just k-, ooh (Yeah)
Just k-, ooh (Yeah)
Just k-, ooh, just k-, ooh
Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world, just you and I
Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world, just you and I (Ohh)

Summer love, by my side
We could rule the world (Rule the world), just you and I (You and I)
Summer love (Summer love), by my side
We could rule the world (You know it), just you and I
Summer love, keep me high
