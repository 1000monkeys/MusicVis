Where will the devil take me if I go to hell?
'Cause I know a place where I'll be strong enough to yell
At the top of my lungs
This road has only just begun
And I don't know what to say to you
But you know what I’m thinkin'
"Won’t you take a breath and listen?
And we’ll be gone any minute"

This is a never ending tale of two hearts
And I'ma stand here waiting until this season starts
This is a never ending tale of two hearts
And I'ma stand here waiting until this season starts
I can't be happy with you

Until the day we make the top
You know I’m never gonna stop
This is a mastercraft of love
And in your mind you see the dark
So I'ma hold you in my arms
This is a mastercraft of love

See I’m not one to quit when I fall
That's because my angel wrapped me up in cotton wool
If you can’t beat em then join em
Well to me thats just poison
And you can stand there and drink it
I'll get my phone I'll record it

Where will the devil take me if I go to hell?
'Cause I know a place where I'll be strong enough
Where will the devil take me if I go to hell?
I can’t be happy with you
Where will the devil take me if I go to hell?
I can’t be happy with you
Where will the devil take me if I go to hell?
I can’t be happy with you
'Cause I know a place where I'll be strong enough
I can't be happy with you

Until the day we make the top
You know I’m never gonna stop
This is a mastercraft of love
And in your mind you see the dark
So I'ma hold you in my arms
This is a mastercraft of love

I can’t be happy with you
I can’t be happy with you
I can’t be happy with you
I can’t be happy with you
I can’t be happy with you
I can’t be happy with you
