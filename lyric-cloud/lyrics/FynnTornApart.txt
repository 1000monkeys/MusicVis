If you won't take my heart
Please take my ring
And I promise I'll be there
When those church bells sing

With our hearts like Velvet (Repeat x2)

Why you ain't hit me up
Because the world was cut off
The world's bill was overdue
Don't give me any attitude
Are you with your friends
If not, can you come over
If not, can I take you out
If not, can I take you down
Or nah, or nah
I know I hate the beach but I
I went for you, oh I
I went for you, oh I
Oh I baby, haven't seen you lately
Do you wear my earrings that I bought you
Do you sing that song I taught you
Let's meet in Florida at ten
As soon as my flight leaves and then


Now hold up wait a minute why you tripping
Now hold up, hold up
Hold up wait a minute I ain't kidding
Now hold up, hold up
Hold up that ass don't drop it
Now hold up, hold up
Now stop it
Yeah

What's a ring to a phone call
What's a phone to a blow job, don't talk like
Ring around the condom, don't pop, don't stop like
Ring around the rosie, don't fall, rodeo
With the bullshit, who's this
Drive-by by Cupid
Nine in the diaper plus she was the driver or sniper
This angel walked the earth the revelations in hand
Spoke a bible verse while I hesitated to write a rap
What if I wrote a poem about your flowing hair
A poem to float your cares and hold your derriere in the open air
A poem to fill your mind, but empty your eyes and catch every tear
A poem any poet could write in mere years
I'm sincere


Matty.: Man, I'm so nervous
Brother: Why are you nervous
Matty.: Like, I just don't want to embarrass her. Like, what I fall on the way to the altar
Brother: Bruh, you got it dog. You got it
Matty.: I just want it to be perfect

Myself
My wife
My love
My life
(repeat x2)
I'm proud of my brother
I know that he love her
I know that he promised to put no one above her
But I see who is she
She's not who she is
She's not who she is

Yup
If you called me I would answer
Answer every question you been asking
You been asking who I've been with, I'm like me
She like, you think you funny
Funny like when you broke my heart
Like my funny bone has been torn apart
Like when I called you didn't answer
You didn't answer every question I been asking
I been asking like
When you coming home
When are you alone
Is Florida as hot as you or is it summer cold
Not cold as in weather
But cold as in whether or not I'll get an answer
Cause you not cuffed anymore like cuffing seasons canceled
Too warm to cuddle
It's too warm to huddle
To plan a breakfast at the huddle house
On the way to the south
And on the way back to Florida
We'll stop at Georgia
Pick peaches and believe
We'll hit the beach soon as we hit the sheets
Every count of thread screams abuse
I'm used to screams
I'm used to you screaming
I'm used to you using sex as an excuse
To get closer to me
But as of late you masturbate
You'd rather date another day
Another year a waste away
