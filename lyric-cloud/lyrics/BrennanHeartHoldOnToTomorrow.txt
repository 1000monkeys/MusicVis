See all the lights, they all shine across the sky
They need for the nights to be so dark to catch your eye
Like the sun needs the rain
And love will need some pain
It'll be all right, the sum is bigger than the parts

We are going to hold on to tomorrow
Moving on from yesterday
We are going to leave behind our sorrows
Break it so it fades away

You will find someone, so please dream on
We are going to hold on to tomorrow now
It's always darkest before the dawn

Hold on, hold on...
Hold on, hold on...
It's always darkest before the dawn
We are going to hold on to tomorrow
Moving on from yesterday
We are going to leave behind our sorrows
Break it till it fades away
Hold on, hold on...
Hold on, hold on...
It's always darkest before the dawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
