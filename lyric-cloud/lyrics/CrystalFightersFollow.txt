You're the one I follow
Follow to the middle
Middle of the shadows
Far away from all the sorrows
You're the one I follow
Follow all the way-o
Way into the darkness
When the sun's shining yellow

You're the one I follow
Follow to the middle
Middle of the shadows
Far away from all the sorrows
You're the one I follow
Follow all the way-oh
Way into the darkness
When the sun's shining yellow

Hollowing out our hole in the world to hide
Hiding in the middle
Away from all the sorrows
Swallow it all down whole
For the freedom I
Feel inside the darkness
When the sky is burning yellow
If any palava needs some honesty
Honestly, honestly, honestly, honestly
Or any disaster needs a remedy
Remedy, remedy, remedy, remedy
I go to you, you come to me
Come with me, come with me, come with me, come with me
And that's just the way it's going to have to be, yeah

Follow, my love, taking everything
'Til the love takes everyone and everyone'll sing
Peace has come, peace has come to let us in
And we're all as one all at one with everything

Follow, my love, taking everything
'Til the love takes everyone and everyone'll sing
Peace has come, peace has come to let us in
And we're all as one all at one with everything

Definite, def-in-i-tely
In you I lost my soul
Following nothing endlessly again (follow)
Your soul's a sea, oh
Your soul's a sea
Your soul's a sea
My body sails so sad (follow)
For the heart in me
The heart in me
The heart in me
Your body sails so sad

Follow, my love, taking everything
'Til the love takes everyone and everyone'll sing
Peace has come, peace has come to let us in
And we're all as one all at one with everything

Follow, my love, taking everything
'Til the love takes everyone and everyone'll sing
Peace has come, peace has come to let us in
And we're all as one all at one with everything

Follow, my love, taking everything

Peace has come, peace has come to let us in
And we're all as one all at one with everything
