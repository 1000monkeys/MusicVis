I know I made a lot of mistakes
I know I'm not perfect in any way
But after all, who's the one to blame
When I don't even know myself
I know I can heal almost anything

Because
I am stronger than I've ever been (strong)
Watch me now, I'm drowning in the deep
It's a burden, I'm not alone here
But it's so quiet since you're gone
I know one day I will be again
Strong

I feel your pain, it's burning my chest
Yeah, I regret that I didn't tell it straight
We didn't rush, we always tried our best
'Cause we never wanted any less
I threw the fuel and you put the flame

Because
I am stronger than I've ever been (strong)
Watch me now, I'm drowning in the deep
It's a burden, I'm not alone here
But it's so quiet since you're gone
I know one day I will be again
Strong


No, I didn't rush, I didn't throw the flame
Didn't break the walls to build them up again
I faced every battle here on my own
I rise and I fall but I'm not alone

We didn't rush, we didn't blow the flame
Didn't break apart, building up again
We crash and we burn out here on our own
We drown, but we breathe 'cause we're not alone

I threw the fuel and you put the flame
'Cause I know I can heal almost anything

Because
I am stronger than I've ever been
Watch me now, I'm drowning in the deep
It's a burden, I'm not alone here
It's so quiet since you're gone (Since you been gone)
I know one day I will be again
Strong
