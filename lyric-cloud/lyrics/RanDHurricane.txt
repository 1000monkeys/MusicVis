I've always, Believed my sins would wash away
But my faith keeps on slipping
I pray, I pray your grace would rescue me
When the waves come crashing
This ocean keeps pulling me under
I can feel you holding me here

I've been, Waiting for my season to change
But the storms are pushing me away
I've been, Living in this season of pain
Staring down the eye of this Hurricane

I see, You put me back piece by piece
Raise me up from the ashes
I believe, Oh God you will rescue me
When the waves come crashing
This ocean keeps pulling me under
I can feel you holding me here


I've been waiting for a sign
There is peace in your eyes
(Eye of the hurricane)
(x3)


Staring down the eye of the Hurricane (x3)
