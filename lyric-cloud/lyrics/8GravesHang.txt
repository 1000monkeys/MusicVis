I wanna hang with my friends
Cause I'm feeling down again
Yeah my body's still bleeding from back stabs and beatings but that happens now and again
The party never ends
And if I didn't hang with them
Who would be there to lie for me, say they would die for me, message my girl in DM
They think I'm a fool
(My trust never falters)
I seem so confused
(The rope's getting longer)
I can't stand the truth
(So I play pretend)
Tighten up your noose
And I'll hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
Cause I put my trust in them
But we'll question our loyalty, turn on our boys, we see one pretty girl come around
The party never ends
And if I didn't hang with them
Who would be there to placate me, fool me with safety, and pour all that booze in my mouth
They think I'm a fool
(My trust never falters)
I seem so confused
(The rope's getting longer)
I can't stand the truth
(So I play pretend)
Tighten up your noose
And I'll hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
People say we're shady and we're shallow
But I can take the words and sticks and stones
Even if they walk me to the gallows
At least I know I'll never walk alone
Alone
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
I wanna hang with my friends
