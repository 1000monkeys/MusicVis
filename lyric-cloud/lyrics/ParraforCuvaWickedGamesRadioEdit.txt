World was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
And I don't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna fall in love
With you
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you
And I don't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna fall in love
With you
With you
And I don't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna fall in love
With you
With you
