I'm bored, that's how it started
Half high and half departed
I pretend I'm brokenhearted
Head deep inside myself
Cross-eyed, I'm twenty-twenty
Hindsight, I'm never sunny
More I think, the less is funny
Real or fake, still can't tell

I could switch my ways
But what would I do with the rest of my days?
I could work this out
But I'm entertained when I'm giving me hell

Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
I don't really try at all
Bangin' my head and my fist up against the wall
Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage

I've got this habit forming
Ignoring every warning
Simple life is stupid boring
Useless drama passes time

I could switch my ways
But what would I do with the rest of my days?
I could work this out
But I'm entertained when I'm giving me hell

Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
I don't really try at all
Bangin' my head and my fist up against the wall
Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
I don't really try at all
Bangin' my head and my fist up against the wall
Maybe I do it to myself
Maybe I do it to myself, self-sabotage
