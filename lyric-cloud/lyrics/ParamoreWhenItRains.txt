And when it rains on this side of town
It touches everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing

You made yourself a bed at the bottom
Of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)
And convinced yourself
That it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And oh oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So, why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

And when it rains, you always find an escape
Just running away from all of the ones who love you
From everything

You made yourself a bed at the bottom
Of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)
And you'll sleep till May
And you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

And oh oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So, why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Take your time, take my time
Take these chances to turn it around
Let's take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around
Just turn it around

Oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming

And oh oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
Oh oh, I need an ending
So, why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

You can take your time, take my time
