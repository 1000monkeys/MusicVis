You want it all, I understand
Gimme the details
 
and take my hand
I think it's time for a new adaption
Just get in line, baby, we’ve got options

Someone to like you, something to wear
Somebody to believe you, with everyone everywhere
It’s a condition, and that’s my business
You had suspicion, but I got promise

Get some freedom
Whatever you want, 
together we're in formation
Just like everyone
All of it now, swallow it down now, woah oh
Woah oh
Woah oh

You’re under order, you’re my recruit
I’ll show you how to execute
I want the willing without the reason
We’ll make a killing on the final season

Get some freedom
Whatever you want, together we're in formation
Just like everyone
All of it now, swallow it down now, woah oh
Woah oh
Get some, get get some
(Someone to like you)
Get some, get some freedom

Get some freedom
Whatever you want, together we're in formation
Just like everyone
All of it now, swallow it down now, woah oh
Get some freedom
Whatever you want, together we're in formation
Just like everyone
All of it now, swallow it down now, woah oh
(lets get it, lets get it, lets get it, lets get it)
