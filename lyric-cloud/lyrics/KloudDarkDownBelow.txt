Take out our hearts just to tear them apart
Putting on a face just to play the part
All these fake emotions
Just to drown in self-devotion

And now we're falling
Now we're falling down, falling down
And we're losing something real to hold on to
It's dark down below
It's dark down below
Don't let it show
Won't let them know
We're burning and we're all alone
It's dark down below
It's dark down below

It's dark down below

And now we're falling
Now we're falling down, falling down
And we're losing something real to hold on to
It's dark down below
It's dark down below
It's dark down below

It's dark down below

All these fake emotions
Just to drown in self-devotion

And now we're falling
Now we're falling down, falling down
And we're losing something real to hold on to
It's dark down below
It's dark down below
Don't let it show
Won't let them know
We're burning and we're all alone
It's dark down below
It's dark down below

It's dark down below
(It's dark down below)
