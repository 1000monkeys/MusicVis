[Verse 1: Olly Simmons, 
Bruno Balanta
]
It doesn't matter what they say
I won't accept it in any single way and-a
Through the floors and-a through the cabling
They're permeating in through every single day
But I won't be confined by their regimented borders
We've got the strength of over fifty thousand soldiers
And we're not duty bound to anybody's orders
(Come on everybody now) 
Don't let 'em run you
[Buildup: Olly Simmons, 
Bruno Balanta
]
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you
(
Do what you want to do
)
(
Do what you want to do
)
(
Do what you want to do

(
Don't let 'em run you
)
Don't let 'em run you!
[Drop 1: 
Bruno Balanta
]
Don't let them run you

They're gonna take it all away
This is a war and the enemies engaging
But you can see through their lies and decide for your life
I won't be confined by their regimented borders
We've got the strength of over fifty thousand soldiers
We're not duty bound to anybody's orders
(Come on everybody now) Don't let 'em run you!

You!
You!
You!
Don't let 'em run you!
Don't let 'em run you
