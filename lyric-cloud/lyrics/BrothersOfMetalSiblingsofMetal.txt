Gods of war
May your hammer be mighty!
Fire blood and steel
The wrath of the gods is all we feel
Metal that is real
Thunder and lightning strikes
As we ride into the night
Hammers and gods of might
We're chasing freedom with ultimate steel
An epic journey begins
Across the wastelands, over the Seven Seas
We are the Brothers of Metal
Ravens are crossing the sky
When a viking is questing arrows fly
Fighting until we die
Hammer and sword held high
We're spreading fear with our battle cry
Reaching for the sky!
On our way to victory we fight for certain death
Forever we are one and we are glorious
We're chasing freedom with ultimate steel
An epic journey begins
Across the wastelands, over the Seven Seas
We are the Brothers of Metal
On our way to victory we fight for certain death
Forever we are one and we are glorious
We're chasing freedom with ultimate steel
An epic journey begins
Across the wastelands, over the Seven Seas
We are the Brothers of Metal
We're chasing freedom with ultimate steel
An epic journey begins
Across the wastelands, over the Seven Seas
We are the Siblings of Metal
