Hold on to the ones you love, but don't squeeze too tight
Even a good thing can steal away like a thief in the night

Wake up tough
On time
Stand up straight
Talk right
Don't let up
Be funny
Be cool
Keep running
I can't keep up
With all these boys
Fast on their feet
Gnashing teeth
They hit you up
And I can't sleep, wolves are coming for me

If you're keeping secrets, secrets from me
I don't need to know baby
Honey keep your secrets, don't matter to me
But these wolves, they keep on scratching at my heart
And I still can't sleep...

Hold on to the ties that bind, but don't get shackled to emotion
You better leave yourself behind before they find you in the open

Wake up tough
On time
Stand up straight
Talk right
Don't let up
Be funny
Be cool
Make that money
You can't keep up
With all these girls
Armed to their teeth
Talking sweet
They don't let up
And I can't sleep, wolves are coming for me

If you're keeping secrets, secrets from me
I don't need to know baby
Honey keep your secrets, don't matter to me
But these wolves, they keep on scratching at my heart
And I still can't sleep...

Wake up tough
On time
Stand up straight
Talk right
Don't let up
Be funny
Be cool
Keep running
You can't keep up
With all these boys
All these girls
Gnashing teeth
They don't let up
And I can't sleep, wolves are coming for me
