When the street lights come on
And the freaks come out at night
We cross bridges til the break of dawn
The city in my heart
So when you look up in the darkest night
Right under the stars
Just remember that you're not alone
You're not alone
The city is mine
The place where I
I wanna be
The city is mine 
Where memories are born
And the streets are full of life
We cross bridges til the break of dawn
The city in my heart
So when you look up in the darkest night
Right under the stars
Just remember that you're not alone
You're not alone
The city is mine
The place where I
I wanna be
