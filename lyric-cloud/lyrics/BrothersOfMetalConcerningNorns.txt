There stands an ash called Yggdrasil
A mighty tree showered in white hail
From there come the dews that fall in the valleys
It stands evergreen above Urd’s Well
From there come maidens, very wise
Three from the lake that lies beneath the pole
One is called Urd, she’s the weaver of fate
Another, Verdandi, who is forever present
Skuld is the third, the future lives within her
Together they carve into the tree
The lives and destinies of children, men and gods
To them, the All-Knowing we pay our dues today
As we bring you our hymn, Yggdrasil
