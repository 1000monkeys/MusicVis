Hold on we brave the waves don’t fall
When the sheriff’s got your back against the wall
You’ll become a slave if you fear to brawl
That’s why we crave to con-quer all
You can catch us switching lanes at the break of dawn
When the rebel spirit answers to my call
When the magic from within is released, reborn
That’s why we crave to con-quer all
 x2
OH OH when we come together
No matta the weather
We gonna love each other till the end of time WOH OH OH
Till the end of time WOH OH OH

Are you ready to face the eye of the storm
When the planets are enraged can you stay calm
Will you find your way when you’ve strayed to far
Whether the distance is great or small
I can show you the way if you gaze at the stars
When the universe leaves all the gates ajar
Whether I’ll be there is no question at all
I could not escape the vortex to which we are drawn
 x2

OH OH when we come together
