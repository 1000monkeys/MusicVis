Gone
And I let it
Go
And I'll get it

Could I ever speak?
Will I ever breach?
How can I be enabled?
If it's a calling of the heart
You cannot see
Can't read a foreign body language
Who am I to teach?
You don't know about growing pains
That were neglected in me
You don't know about warning signs
Ignored and left at the scene
Indeed I'm known to
Falling standards
Who am I to preach?

Gone
But you couldn't understand
And I let it
So I lied again
Go
And I wouldn't let you in
And I'll get it
So you cast another stone
You'll find it on your own
If I let it
I better let it go

You will let me down now
'Cause you could not lift it
I'll back down
When I cannot stand the weight
We'll wake up to breaking hearts
I know it
You will let me down now
'Cause you could not lift it
I'll back down
When I cannot stand the weight
We'll wake up to breaking hearts
I know it
To breaking hearts
I know it

Could I ever meet
Ever present needs?
How can I be relabeled?
If it has always been indoctrinated in me
That heathens die and love is blind
Now who am I to see?

Gone
But you couldn't understand
And I let it
So I lied again
Go
And I wouldn't let you in
And I'll get it
So you cast another stone
You'll find it on your own
If I let it
I better let it
Go

You will let me down now
'Cause you could not lift it
I'll back down
When I cannot stand the weight
We'll wake up to breaking hearts
I know it
You will let me down now
'Cause you could not lift it
I'll back down
When I cannot stand the weight
We'll wake up to breaking hearts
I know it
To breaking hearts
I know it

All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Irrelevant
All left out
We were left out
Again

You will let me down now
'Cause you could not lift it
I'll back down
When I cannot stand the weight
We'll wake up to breaking hearts
I know it
You will let me down now
'Cause you could not lift it
I'll back down
When I cannot stand the weight
We'll wake up to breaking hearts
I know it
To breaking hearts
I know it

Now good luck
Holding it together
Gone
And I let it
Go
And I'll get it
Gone
