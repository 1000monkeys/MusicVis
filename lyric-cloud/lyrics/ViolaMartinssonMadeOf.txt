This is what I'm made of
I will never ever let go
This is what I'm made of
No one can control me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
You can hate but never break me
This is what I'm made of

You can try but never stop me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
I will never ever let go
'Cause this is what I'm made of
No one can control me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
You can hate but never break me
'Cause this is what I'm made of

You can try but never stop me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
I will never ever let go
'Cause this is what I'm made of

No one can control me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
You can hate but never break me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
No one can control me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
You can hate but never break me
'Cause this is what I'm made of
