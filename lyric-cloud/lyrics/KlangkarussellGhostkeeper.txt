Ghostkeeper
Why you always gotta hang 'round here
They're all wishing that you'd disappear
Can't keep waiting on the air to clear
Ghostkeeper
You're the only one that's still hung up
On the stories that we used to love
Is it ever gonna be enough?

Ghostkeeper
Ooh, ooh
Ghostkeeper
Ohh, ooh

Ghostkeeper
All the mornings that you can't get through
And the nights when you're alone with you
Live a lifetime you'll still be confused
Ghostkeeper
You keep holding on to what we were
While you tell yourself it's you who's cursed
But it's not your fault that I went first

Ghostkeeper
Ooh, ooh
Ghostkeeper
Ohh, ooh
