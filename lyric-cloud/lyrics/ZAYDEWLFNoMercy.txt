You thought you knew me
You thought you knew me well
But I keep on messing it up
I drank the poison
It got into my bones
Now I keep on tearing you up

I've seen that mania
Can't say I'm blaming ya
You've been calling me insane-ah!
Let loose that rage in ya

'Cause I don't want your mercy
I don't want your mercy
Don't hold back, give it to me now
Don't hold back, give it to me now
I don't want your mercy
I don't want your mercy
No mercy

Don't think about it
Use the weapons in your head
And keep on shooting me up
I'll be here standing
Even when I'm looking dead
Just let it out, open the flood

I've seen that mania
Can't say I'm blaming ya
You've been calling me insane-ah!
Let loose that rage in ya

'Cause I don't want your mercy
I don't want your mercy
Don't hold back, give it to me now
Don't hold back, give it to me now
I don't want your mercy
I don't want your mercy
No mercy

One day we're gonna wake up
And stand there like we're king and queen
Everything that kept us paralyzed
Was nothing but a bad dream
One day we're gonna wake up
And stand there like we're king and queen
Everything that kept us paralyzed
Was nothing but a bad dream

I don't want your mercy, Lord, no
I don't want your mercy
I don't want your mercy, no, no
Don't hold back, give it to me now
I don't want your mercy
I don't want your mercy
No mercy
