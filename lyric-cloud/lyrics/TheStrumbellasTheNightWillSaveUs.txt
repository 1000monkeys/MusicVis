She took me on a rollercoaster
I have never gone down
We bought an old farm house
And paid to have it all torn down
We sat under an oak tree
And watched as every leaf hit the ground
The sky became a painting
We watched as the planes crashed down

I'm waiting for the night to save us
I'm waiting for the night to take us
I'm waiting for the night to wake us
I'm waiting for the night to break us

We stood atop the jukebox
And sang until the cavalry came
Our thoughts were bleeding colors
The rifles cocked and took their aim
And we took off all our clothes
And marched in a perfect line
We sat and talked for hours
Laughed and drank the cheapest wine

I'm waiting for the night to save us
I'm waiting for the night to take us
I'm waiting for the night to wake us
I'm waiting for the night to break us
I'm waiting for the night to save us
I'm waiting for the night to take us
I'm waiting for the night to save us
I'm waiting for the night to break us

I don't know where to go
And I don't know where is my home
But we carry on
I don't know where to go
And I don't know where is my home
But we carry on

I'm waiting for the night to save us
I'm waiting for the night to take us
I'm waiting for the night to wake us
I'm waiting for the night to break us
I'm waiting for the night to save us
I'm waiting for the night to take us
I'm waiting for the night to wake us
I'm waiting for the night to break us

Carry on
Carry on
