It's BOBBY by the way
Let's get it

Welcome to the wild, no heroes and villains
Welcome to the war we've only begun, so
Pick up your weapon and face it
There's blood on the crown go and take it
You get one shot to make it out alive, so

Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your bones, go and take it
This is your moment, now is your time, so (Yuh)

Prove yourself and (Hey)
Rise (Rise), rise (Rise)
Make 'em remember you
Yuh, busy chasing 왕관 위치 홍대 down town
There's blood on the crown, ow

Push through hell and
Rise (Rise), rise (Rise)
They will remember you
Yuh, busy chasing 왕관 위치 홍대 down town
There's blood on the crown, ow
Rise

Welcome to the climb up, reach for the summit
Visions pray that one false step lead the end, so

Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your blood, go and take it
This is your moment, take to the skies, go (Yuh)

Prove yourself and (Hey)
Rise (Rise), rise (Rise)
Make 'em remember you
Yuh, busy chasing 왕관 위치 홍대 down town
There's blood on the crown, yuh
