Chorus:
There's still ramblin' in the rambler let him go
You'll never tame him darling and you know
He'll break your heart in two
And after that he still ain't through
There's still ramblin' in the rambler let him go
Up till dawn and drinking every night
Bailin' him out in the morning after another bar room fight
Cook for him a supper he will never see
Briefcase-totin' boy you know he'll never be

Wonderin' if the car is wrecked, if he's dead or not
He'll meet you at the ballet after just one more Jaegermeister shot
That five hundred bucks you loaned him that you will never see
Briefcase-totin' boy you know he'll never be

Finding him in the morning passed out on the kitchen floor
He explains that's where he fell down when he came in the door
After all of this my darling ain't it plain to see
That old whisky drinking, bluegrass listening, Carhartt wearing, all night roaming rambler he'll always be
