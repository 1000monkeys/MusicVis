(Whoa)
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for (Whoa)
You’ve been searchin' in the dark
Your sweat soakin' through the floor (Whoa)
And buried in your bones, there’s an ache that you can't ignore
Takin' your breath, stealing your mind
And all that was real is left behind

Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don’t care what comes after
Your fever dream, can’t you see it gettin' closer?
Just surrender ’cause you feel the feelin' takin' over
It's fire, it’s freedom, it's floodin' open
It's the preacher in the pulpit and your blind devotion
There's somethin' breakin' at the brick of every wall
It's holdin' all that you know, so tell me do you wanna go?

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

(Whoa)
Colossal we come these renegades in the ring (Whoa)
Where the lost get found, and we crown 'em the circus kings

Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
It's blindin', outshinin' anything that you know
Just surrender 'cause you're callin' and you wanna go

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, intoxicating you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the walls can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
