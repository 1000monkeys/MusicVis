I bruise fools when I lose my cool
Crush crews snatch fools then react with tools
On some 94 shit while i act gat clickity clack
You back down like cowards and rats
Pharoah clique rainin
Blood stainin on the pavement
We the judge jury executioners at your arraignment
You ain't got a chance in hell face all swell from the tears
Now your homies pourin out they beers
For years we put it down
Now we comin for the crown
With your head still attached this that bull dog rap
Call me spike call my forty cal lil spike junior
And his twin brother death comin to a nigga sooner
Yo the warnins in the air torture papers over there
Better read up or live your wothless life outta fear
Yo the warnins in the air torture papers over there
Better read up (Read up)
Yeah Im with my fifth state to state
And I'm on it and together we ride out
If the cops come we play Bonnie n Clyde (Yeah)
Two bricks and two tommy's inside
In two minutes we gonna have two bodies to hide
Look the cops wanna give me 20 to life
My wife's 20 gotta daughter she depend on my life (Ill)
Stressed out feelin lonely I scream
That's when I woke up it was only a dream
Nigga reality check stuck in a cell
Mom's stressin cuz her first son's up in the jail
Got two containers on me I ain't stuck with a bail
Black judge lookin at me like you fuckin with hell
23 years old with a daughter to raise
My baby momma dumb bitch I ain't call her in days (Bitch)
? ? ? and my daughter I miss you
Don't think cuz I ain't hit your mommy up I'm tryin to diss you
And I'm Low
