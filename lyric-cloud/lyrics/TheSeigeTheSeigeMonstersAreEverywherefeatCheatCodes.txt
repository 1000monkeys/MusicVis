Venni vetti vecci
They need answers, i’m Rafiki
The devil tried me so I put him underneath me
I do not surrender choose kill me now or free
Moving through the night
We came to fight
Don’t make it easy, hold up
Got an army full of gladiators
Monsters
Head dresses got us looking like some rastas
Honestly there ain't enough power on your roster
You and your mob boy y’all just some flash mobsters
Turn up
We can turn this town out
This a revolution pick a side ... townhouse
You can hear our battle cry from about a mile out
We just some kids that fell through the cracks
Outhouse
Whoop
This a war and we accept
Trying to set the bar high like BMX
We on point y’all never there
Keep your eyes peeled monsters are everywhere
The devil already know
There’s only bout’ two ways this will go
I can’t have control cause I have given away my soul
The devil already know
There’s only bout’ two ways this will go
I can’t have control
Cause I have given away my soul
Cause I been marching along just like a soldier
Trying to keep my mind close like a gun in a holster
Ain't black or white ain't no day or night
Can’t tell if i’m messed up or sober
And I swear good ain't enough when you’re fighting against your self
I don’t know why I love being bad but it feels so damn good I swear
The devil already know
There’s only bout’ two ways this will go
I can’t have control cause I have given away my soul
The devil already know
There’s only bout’ two ways this will go
I can’t have control
Cause I have given away my soul
I know you thinking that you gonna come defeat me
To be honest man you probably really need me
Listen i’m Christian Bale on these tracks
Denzel with these facts
You can’t even tip the scale with your act
I’m a bear need a meal and you barely a snack
I ain't seen nothing tougher than being black
It seems like y’all can’t get enough of just being wack
Would teens kill themselves if the world cut them some slack?
If teachers taught them facts and their parents got off their backs?
Would Pam ever let Cole hit from the back?
Let me think though life is just a freak show
The only way to thrive is to grow and Ego
Monster
The devil already know
There’s only bout’ two ways this will go
I can’t have control cause I have given away my soul
The devil already know
There’s only bout’ two ways this will go
I can’t have control
Cause I have given away my soul
