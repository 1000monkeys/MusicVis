Perfume on my shirt puts me in the past
Too lonely to be happy, but too afraid to ask

Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle, yeah

Too young to settle down, too old to be in bars
It's hard to take it easy, it’s easy to be hard, yeah

Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle

Forgive me, I am building my ship as it sails
How do I become who I wanna be while still remaining myself?

People love the old me and don't know where he's gone
Too tired to be famous, too vain to be unknown, yeah (Hey)

Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am, here I am again)
Here I am again, stuck in the middle (Ahh)

Here I am, here I am again, here I am
Here I am, here I am again, here I am
Here I am, here I am again, here I am
Here I am, here I am again, here I am
