Yeah

I hate it when you're here but you're not here
Hate it when your friends turn to old peers
Hate it when you talk but you don't hear
Hate it when your energy feels weird
Last time I think I laughed, it was last year
Made more money last month than the past year
When everything feels fake, only facts here
I remember working back as a cashier, simpler times
Now it's been three weeks, still the page is empty
They hang on every word I fuckin' say
While I appreciate you, wait for my perspective
Gotta keep it real, there's somethin' else in play
Somethin' I can't explain, yeah
Like the lyrics I find in my mind were put in my brain, damn
Is it really that deep? Maybe it's me
Then one day, I came across what the Romans believed
And even the Greek
You see, they believe we create from our Genii
It's not in our genes, that got me to think
'Bout rappers who claim that they're more than just human
Promote what they pour in their drink
Was makin' me think, I needed a substance to create
With somethin' that wasn't in me
But pardon me, please
Fuck all that nonsense
I believe that my music is bigger than me
If I'm bein' honest
And I think that it's lame for an artist
To claim they're a god or a goddess
Because that type of thinkin' is silently killing off all of our artists
While the industry profit, fillin' their wallets, damn

Feel like I'm on a hamster wheel
While I focus on makin' the music
You don't need your hands to feel
Is it fair when we follow our passion
We barely can land a meal?
In an industry where they can take
They don't need hands to steal!
They told me, "Go get a degree!"
Was stupid for followin' dreams
Your job was to push me to think
Instead you're just hurdling sheep
I spill out my soul into ink
I told 'em I need to pursue what I love
If not, then I'm makin' this money for what?
Buy shit from a brand led by someone that does
I needed to find out who I really was, nowâ€¦
They would never get it
Said I couldn't do it, so they were shook when I did it
They never could see the vision, they never wanted me winnin'
I never need an opinion, I never was one to fit it
Too fast to follow along, then I'll bring it back in a minute
I take the beat for a trip and I'll bring it back when I'm finished
I see my room as a womb, and I build and grow while I'm in it
I'm livin', but am I livin'? I can't even tell the difference

Since the last four lines, it's been about one week
Anxiety hit me real hard, and I think
I've been sacrificin' my own mental to prove
The potential in me with the music they seek
'Cause the more that I'm makin', the more that they need
The more that I'm open, the more that I bleed
The more that they're lyin', the less I believe
The more that I please 'em, the less that I'm me
I been back and forth, daily
Am I even making art, or did the art make me?
No wonder why I'm feelin' lost lately
Do they hate the art, or do they really hate me?
They're so negative on the daily
But I don't need your help, to me I'm twice as mean
Yeah, I'm twice as mean, it's seemin' like your dream
Is really only takin' shots at my self-esteem, mo'fucker!
You question why you should care
Like, "This don't affect what I do"
But maybe, just maybe, if you change your thinkin'
Then you would find you'd start believin' in you
You see, as a human, you're made to create
Not just sit at a desk with some paper and glue
And maybe, just maybe, we do have a genius
So all of the blame and the praise is for two, damn

So, who am I when the world tells me who I should be?
Look around, you'll see ideas are essential as air and sleep
Everything you see, it came from the mind of a human being
That's mind-blowin', you're not your mistakes or the fears you think
And I think, I need to pray and take care of myself more
Deep hidden in my mind's where you'll find Piece of Mind 4
