Hahaha! That's actually the laughter we need, that's the one. Hahaha!
(It's Capital!)

Even when it's cool in the winter time
Rainfall in the summer time
And through the shifting of the paradigms
I'll forever say you're hella fine
And I just pray that you're forever mine
Said even when it's cool in the winter time
Rainfall in the summer time
And through the shifting of the paradigms
I'll forever say you're hella fine
And I just pray that you're forever mine

Romantic comedies are overrated
And I'm just glad it lasted longer than I contemplated
My love is poured into a glass of
I'm concentrated
I'm just hoping you and I can dash to the complicated
Remember that moment at that corner when I saw you
And told you that I loved you and you laughed
And you asked
Do I love you for your brains or your ass
And I laughed and I asked
Do you even need to ask
I was just talking trash then
We passed then
Now our love is high fashion
Passion attraction
Bashed into one super action
And I love the fact that we're mad friends
And we're only getting better though
And as far as letters go
I just wanna let you know
I will never let you go
'Cause you and I will forever be connected souls
Even though...

I mic checked it like 1 2 3 and to the 4
And this a dedication to the lady I adore
You always had my back when I was hustling for raps
And I just couldn't ask for much beyond that
Look, we made 'em switch it up
To premium from compact
Steady outchere thanking contracts
Now we gotta double the capital
With Capital from the capital city
To the top of the map
We're bringing it back
Sweet melodies we're singing it back
Dark ? bringing melanin back
Now where my ladies at
All my shorties on the chase for the cash
Who know that money ain't a thing you should ask
All soul with a digital dash
Control with a bit of a past
She a freak but she cava the class
Her back make a nigga do back flips
Me and Cap we don't dala no gymnastics

Even when it's cool in the winter time
Rainfall in the summer time
And through the shifting of the paradigms
I'll forever say you're hella fine
And I just pray that you're forever mine

We are just people looking for something
For some kind of purpose
And a reason to breathe
My search was considered over
'Cause in you I found my reason to be
Love is a beautiful thing
Beautiful thing, beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing
Beautiful thing, beautiful thing
Beautiful thing, beautiful thing, beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing
