Murdering instrumentals god I need repentance
Please forgive me please don’t give me the life sentence
Moving shit mentally with telekinesis
No decreases when I create too many  masterpieces
Fast movement lyrically landing on the surface
Then I create so much mayhem on purpose
I wish I could restart my life like a video
Crop out the violence, truancy, and all these silly hoes
Ms Jackson I'm sorry for drinking that Bacardi
And fornicating all those women at the local party
But its hard when u fantasize about Ferrari's
On the iPod looking at women on safari
No need to explain my intellect I perfect
My dialect through complex subjects
Rough sex you'll bust thru a Trojan latex
My spirit connects bitch you ain't no apex
Realize you could fuck up the earth in a second
Just need possessions of nuclear weapons
But we all human we all need  corrections
We all got secrets we all got confessions
My niggas sitting on da couch intoxicated
Everybody know that my raps are underrated
My pupils dilated when my adrenaline accelerated
Getting scared like a pig when you get interrogated
A fucking solider that’s a fact bitch military tactics
Is what I use so don’t make me loose my shit
This me no faking its all me
Told Tim bob if he got conflict just call me
Ain't no got damn peace in the muthackin' streets
When you decease
Stray bullet hits the niece when they release
No reaction from the police
'Cause it's to many niggas in da world that bang bang like chief keef

Ugh, It only takes one call, yes one call my nigga
That's all to ball but i ball my nigga
Not at all if i felt like I've been overcharged
I just feel like i'ma starter and I'm trying to start
In my own damn road, yes i got the control
Yes I've been on the top shelf and no nigga knows
Yes i been on this road, and been in it alone
I just need me a clone just to know that i'm on
I been doing so much work that the work hurts
And i feel that like i'm in hearse first but the dirt works
Well i feel the gravel and i know its real
Reality just set in and i know that i'm trill
And you over here with the deficient you know its skill
And you already know with a verse of mine ill probably kill
And you mad because my records raw
And you mad because my records raw
I freestyle 'cause i feel like that's real in me
And everybody like damn you can feel in me
I got the energy that no nigga can reciprocate
I feel like with raps i gotta go humiliate
And decapitate my competition
When it comes to me i'm the tom cruise impossible missions
I'm sorry mission impossibles if it comes to my raps
Best to believe i'm unstoppable
Energetic person forget what you can say anytime
Nigga i been killing this with any rhyme
To sit back on any crime
Just to say i'm different than any rapper that's anytime
And you can say this is hell
To me your raps are just a visceral betrayal
So put it the documents and file it up

'Cause this is ain't
'Cause this is ain't
'Cause this is ain't
'Cause this is ain't
Watch this T.R.E

These lyrical quotes come from the notes
Of a future goat chemical disaster explodes
History repeats itself duplicate episodes
My mouth is like AK when it cock back and reloads
On another planet resting with philosophers
The ones who got a GED all the way to a PHD
I'm official as it gets when i write hieroglyphs
I'm spitting hallow tips gun powder off my lips nigga
Finding scriptures to extract these  demons
Bullets in his torso fuck a doctor we need a deacon
Women get naked round me and start streaking
This lyrical diagnose is succeeding
I'm great like Malcolm X or martin king in they prime
But here's the thing u gotta assassinate me 3 times
Don't really do it nigga that's just a rhyme
'Cause ya homeboy might go all the way to the cops
N drop a dime
I'll take 5 rappers of the block while i'm drunk off gin
Top all of them with they weak ass synonyms
Round ABOUT 10 more niggas up once again
That's 15 rappers i just murdered that's 15 sins
Flowing like the pacific ocean
Or like when she gets an orgasm explosion
And that's a whole another topic
Can't stop my profit or you can't stop my articulate logic
I'm a be still be the topic even after I'm fossils
Rollin' wit a clique like the 12 apostles
