Lyrics:
0:00:00 RIOT - Blackwater
In a time when lawmen were outlaws
A thief, a cutthroat, and a bounty hunter
Face an enemy of a new kind
Through the uncharted lands of the West
A fistful of men ride for the Blackwater

Tonight, an unsettling tone lingers in the air
The sound makes the horses shriek in fear
From above, piercing thunder roars
The earth has visitors
This is the sound of a machine
Now staring into the sky
The stars dissipate to make way
As a mechanical beast makes its descent towards the earth
Through galaxies in space and tales old as time
Fear finds a way into the heart of every man of the Blackwater

Blackwater
(Blackwater)

(Blackwater)

From above, piercing thunder roars
The earth has visitors
This is the sound of a machine
Now staring into the sky
The stars dissipate to make way
As a mechanical beast makes its descent towards the earth

Blackwater
(Blackwater)

(Blackwater)

0:10:51 Feint & Laura Brehm - Solace
I could tell within a moment you knew me well
I could see you gave me solace when I needed someone there
In the darkness, I still see you like a golden arch
Rising high above the sunset in every way you are

I know that everything's in focus now
I'm seeing clearly for the first time
Today, I woke up feeling more alive
Tomorrow, everything will turn around

Everything will turn around
Everything will turn around

All the days when I was searching for some kind of sign
Now I've reached the destination, with someone of my kind
Keep me breathing with a feeling like an LED light
Now I'm moving through the shadows, you woke me up tonight

I know that everything's in focus now
I'm seeing clearly for the first time
Today, I woke up feeling more alive
Tomorrow, everything will turn around

Everything will turn around
Everything will turn around
0:14:54 Mazare & Essenger - Berserker
Left to walk these halls
A wasteland in my mind (A wasteland in my mind)
I've become so cold
A phantom running blind (A phantom running blind)

So hopeless, I know this could be the end
(I know this could be the end)
Iâ€™ll fight â€™til you break down and let me in

I'll fight â€™til you break down and let me in

Break down and let me in
Break down and let me in

Swear I felt relief
A shred of pure catharsis (A shred of pure catharsis)
Behind the gates you keep
A shelter from the darkness (A shelter from the darkness)

So hopeless, I know this could be the end
(I know this could be the end)
I'll fight 'til you break down and let me in

I'll fight â€™til you break down and let me in

Break down and let me in
Break down and let me in
Break down and let me in
Break down and let me in

0:37:52 Kill Paris - Fizzy Lifting Drink (ft. Big Gigantic & Jimi Tents)
When I would dream, they told me stop
There's so much hate, it made me nauseous
Work this out, it's made me cautious
I exerted every option
Count me out, must think I lost it
Losing sleep; somehow, I fought it
I heard life was a box of chocolates
Saying she's sweet around here is toxic
Made the most of what we got
We go hard, been through a lot
So we party till we drop
Tell the neighbors it won't stop
Why should shorty hit me up on days I need a pick me up?
I just wanna live it up
Can somebody lift me up?
Sure, I can't come down
The worst night was when you stayed, grounded
Sure, I can't come down
The worst night was when you stayed, grounded
I just wanna live it up
Can somebody lift me up?
0:39:59 Bossfight - Overdose (ft. Philip Strand)
I'm sick and tired of all the fightin'
I've had enough of all the wars
Don't wanna think about it anymore
I'm tired of the feelin'
We are always headin' for the door

So tell me, if I say it loud
Would you come alive?
Would you hold me like you used to do?
Tell me, if I say it loud
Will my heart survive?
Will it beat the way it did for you?

If you wanna stay, let me know it
Turn the page, come on over
If you're not afraid to let me close
I will be your overdose
If you wanna stayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tay
Tayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tay
Tayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tayâ€”tay
I will be your overdose, overdose

If I say it loud, will my heart survive?
I will be your overdose

Am I right to doubt?
'Cause I think we had it wrong from the start
Took a bite, spit it out
When I saw you had a poisonous heart

So tell me, if I say it loud
Will you come alive?
Will you hold me like you used to do?
Tell me, if I say it loud
Will my heart survive?
Will it beat the way it did for you?

If you wanna stay
If you wanna stay
If you wanna stay, let me know it
Turn the page, come on over
If you're not afraid to let me close
I will be your overdose
If you wanna stay, let me know
Turn the page, come on over
If you're not afraid to let me close
I will be your overdose
I will be your overdose

If I say it loud, will you come alive?
I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll
I will be your overdose

1:02:40 Julian Calor - Monster (ft. Trove)
I had a dream you died last night
I woke up mouthing things I should've said
But I slept on those words instead
You haunt the stairways in my head

You're the monster under my bed
Reach for me when I repent
And I should've looked
I should've looked
You're the monster under my bed
Making mess I keep tryna address
Cannot come to terms
With the monster under my bed

I should've looked, ooh

I told you secrets I should've kept
You spill them up as I collect (Oh, ah)
But I fall for it half a million times
Like a bad old house, just one peek inside
You're the mystery with hell of a history
And my hands are red

You're the monster under my bed
Reach for me when I repent
And I should've looked
I should've looked
You're the monster under my bed
Making mess I keep tryna address
Cannot come to terms
With the monster under my bed

Yeah, I should've looked
I should've looked, ooh

I should've looked
I should have looked
1:06:05 Justin OH - Don't Bring Me Down
If I can, if I could build you up
Don't bring me down

If I can, if I could build you up
Don't bring me down, bring me down
If I fall, then would you lift me up?
Would you lift me up or bring me down?

It would like to start the beginning of a revolution
Let's go
They keep getting nothing

Let's go
This is only the beginning

If I can, if I could build you up
Don't bring me down, bring me down
If I fall, then would you, lift me up?
Would you lift me up, or bring me down?
[Bridge}
A few of them
They are rising against me
Find them
All of them
Forgive them
They don't understand that they need me

Let's go
They keep getting nothing

(Uh, uh)
This is only the beginning
Let's go (Switch)
It's the future

If I can, if I could rebuild you up
Don't bring me down, bring me down
If I fall, then would you lift me up?
Would you lift me up or bring me down?
