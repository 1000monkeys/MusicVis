And shepherds we shall be
For Thee, my Lord, for Thee
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command
So we shall flow a river forth unto Thee
And teaming with souls, shall it ever be
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti
And so the Headhunterz made a sacrifice
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti
Sacrifice
For Thee, my Lord, for Thee
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command
So we shall flow a river forth unto Thee
And teaming with souls, shall it ever be
Boundaries are there to be crossed
Sacrifice
