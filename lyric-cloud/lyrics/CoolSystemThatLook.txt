Southside nigga how I drip
Sauce on a nigga be the southside dip
Know it's been a minute, been down, took a hit
But I know you never heard a jiggy record like this
Sucka MC's back down this is it
Double L cool but I'm Jay with the flip
How you niggas say you really repping for the kids when you try to put us down every second that you get?
That's cool
Look at how we blossom
Under 25 and we bossin'
Never seen the city tryna flip it on it's head , 'til a nigga saw a PatLee moshpit
(oooou damn)
Now I'm the cabin
'Cause a nigga really tryna get established
Sitting in the burg
Busy plotting with the birds
Tryna figure how to get my daisy planted

Southside nigga where the daisies
Man I'm from the city that made me
Southside nigga where the daisies
Man I'm from the city that made me
Southside nigga where the daisies
Man the way I'm steady tryna rock it out
You would think I'm tryna make it to the Daisies

I been on a mission better listen
'Bout to take you niggas out the bidness
And I'm 'bout to hit you with a missle
Child of Indigo you know we steady in position
Really I ain't fvcking with the system
On the interchange how we driven
Leave you niggas looking like a Griffin
God's light show me how I glisten
How to turn a verse into a written?
Eyy pseudo how you southside drip?
'Cause every time i see you got that Southside dip
Is you in the 51 packing with the trip?
With the daisy in the bag
And the blossom be your hit?
Eyy man
Now I got the pettles on my feet
Sticking to the roots so you know I got the seed
Steady in the stu 'cause I never ever sleep
Imma put that on my momma when we double balance sheets

"HIP-HOP IS GOING IN THE DIRECTION WHERE IT’S, IT'S LIKE 100 OR ALMOST DAMN NEAR 100 PERCENT ON EVERYTHING BESIDES THE MUSIC. LIKE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME TO, WHAT YOU’RE WEARING, THE BRAND OF CLOTHING WHATEVER INTOXICANTS YOU CHOOSE TO PUT IN YOUR BODY, TO YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING EXPECT FOR WHAT THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE."
