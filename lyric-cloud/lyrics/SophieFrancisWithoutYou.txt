Oh bae, we're doing this
It felt right, but I'm done with it
I'm done with it
No one, came close to it
So bright, but you faded
But you faded
You keep saying that I need your body by my side
But, the truth is that I'm good without you in my life, yeah
Oh bae, and now you know that
Better off, I'm never coming back
I'm never coming back

So don't you worry, worry, worry, worry, worry
And I'm still hot without you
I'm still hot without you
Don't you worry, worry, worry, worry, worry
And I'm still hot without you
I'm still hot without you, you

I'm still hot without you, you
I'm still hot without you, you

I know, it's crazy
You thought, I was your baby
I was your baby
You keep saying that I need your body by my side
But, the truth is that I'm good without you in my life, yeah
Oh bae, and now you know that
Better off, I'm never coming back
I'm never coming back

So don't you worry, worry, worry, worry, worry
And I'm still hot without you
I'm still hot without you
Don't you worry, worry, worry, worry, worry
And I'm still hot without you
I'm still hot without you, you

I'm still hot without you, you
I'm still hot without you, you

You keep saying that I need your body by my side
But, the truth is that I'm good without you in my life, yeah
Oh bae, now you know that
Better off, I'm never coming back
I'm never coming back, back, back, back

So don't you worry, worry, worry, worry, worry (don't you worry)
And I'm still hot without you
I'm still hot without you
Don't you worry, worry, worry, worry, worry (no, no)
And I'm still hot without you (I'm still hot)
I'm still hot without you, you (I'm still hot)

I'm still hot without you, you
I'm still hot without you, you
