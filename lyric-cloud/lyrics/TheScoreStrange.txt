Lately I've been thinking everyone around me is insane
March in single file 'cause they're thinking that it's the only way
But I'm never gonna fall in line
Never gonna live like I'm color blind
Living in between all the black and white, oh
Lately I've been thinking that there's something wrong inside my brain

I just feel so strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange
Strange
The harder I try, I don't recognize
I just feel so

Sometimes I can't tell between the highs when I'm lost in the low
Everything is backwards when I'm staring at the people below
I'm standing outside like a renegade
When everybody's here in this masquerade
Their eyes cut through like a razor blade, oh
Sometimes I can't tell that they are better with the devil they know

Maybe I'm just strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange
Strange
The harder I try, I don't recognize
I just feel so
Am I the only one alone?
I'm losing grip on everything I used to know
Strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so

Am I the only one that feels this way?
I keep on running, but I can't escape
Am I the only one that feels this way?
'Cause I feel this way
'Cause I feel this way
Am I the only one that feels this way?
I keep on running, but I can't escape
Am I the only one that feels this way?
'Cause I feel this way
'Cause I feel this way

I just feel so strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange
Strange
The harder I try, I don't recognize
I just feel so
Am I the only one alone?
I'm losing grip on everything I used to know
Strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so

Strange
