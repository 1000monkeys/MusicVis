I see you when you're down
And depressed, just a mess
I see you when you cry
When you're shy, when you wanna die
I see you when you smile
It takes a while; at least, you're here
I see you
Yes, I see you

(I'm alone with you
You're alone with me)

I see you when you hide
And when you lie, it's no surprise
I see you when you run
From the light within your eyes
(I see you)
When you think
That I don't notice all those scars
I see you
Yes, I see you

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
What a mess you've made of everything
I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself

Like I see you
Yes, I see you
I see you
Yes, I see you
(I'm alone with you)
(You're alone with me)

I see you when you chase
All the dreams inside your head
I see you when you laugh
And when you love 'til the bitter end
(I see you)
In the dark, at the dawn of something new
I see you
Yes, I see you

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself

Like I see you
Yes, I see you
I see you
Yes, I see you

Even when you cry and even when you're shy
You mean everything to me
Even when you lie and even when you hide
You mean everything to me

I see you
(I see you, I see you, I see you)
Yes, I see you
(I see you, I see you, I see you)
I see you
(Even when you cry and even when you're shy)
Yes, I see you
(I see you, I see you, I see you)

I'm alone with you, you're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself
