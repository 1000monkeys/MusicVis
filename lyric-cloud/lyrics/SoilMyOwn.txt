Feel my angst
Deep within me
Feed my strength
Your words are empty
Look inside and you will see
Break inside break inside
I am, my own
And that's something to me
I've grown, Too strong
To be under your feet
See the hands
That try to hold me
Read the past
I never was free
Look inside and you will see
Break inside break inside
I am, my own
And that's something to me
I've grown, Too strong
To be under your feet
Deeds of shame
The world around me
Know my pain
The world that I see
Look inside and you will see
Break inside break inside
I am, my own
And that's something to me
I've grown, Too strong
To be under your feet
