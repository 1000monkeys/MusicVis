Driving down this road for an hour, tryna get away
I could go to Rome or De Janeiro, but it all looks the same

Miles and miles, I've traveled the world
I've never felt someone like you
I can't explain it, you're inside my head
Wherever I go, I see you

Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go

Every time we touch, turn to fire, but we both love the pain
Turning up the radio, it's static, but I only hear your name

Miles and miles, I've traveled the world
I've never felt someone like you
I can't explain it, you're inside my head
Wherever I go, I see you

Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go

Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go
Wherever I go

Is it good?
