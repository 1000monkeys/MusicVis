Jump!

I don't wanna wake up today
'Cause every day's the same
And I've been waiting so long
For things to change
I'm sick of this town, sick of my job
Sick of my friends 'cause everyone's jaded
Sick of this place, I wanna break free
I'm so frustrated

I just wanna jump! (Jump!)
Don't want to think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go, whoa
Forget your problems
I just wanna jump

I don't wanna wake up one day
And find out it's too late
To do all the things I wanna do
So I'm gonna pack up my bags
I'm never coming back
'Cause the years are passing by
And I'm wasting all my ti-ti-time
I'm sick of this house sick of being broke
Sick of this town that's bringing me down
I'm sick of this place, I wanna break free
I'm so frustrated

I just wanna jump! (Jump!)
Don't want to think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go, whoa
Forget your problems
I just wanna jump
I just wanna jump

I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore

Forget tomorrow, I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go, whoa
Forget your problems
It's time to let them go, whoa
Forget tomorrow, I just wanna jump (Jump!)
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Yeah! I just wanna jump (Jump!)
I just wanna jump
