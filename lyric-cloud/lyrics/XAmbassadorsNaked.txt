I ain't no Ken and you ain't no Barbie (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't none of my friends have a perfect body (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If we had it all, go, go
Baby, if we let it all go, go
Baby, we could break the mold, mold
Not afraid to show, I just wanna say

From my head to my toes
Feeling overexposed
I wanna be naked with you
All my faults, all your scars
Who I am, who you are
I wanna be oh, naked with you, naked with you


No, we ain't no Brad and Angelina (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, we don't let that bother us either (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If we let it all go, go
Maybe if we let it all go, go
Maybe we just let 'em all know, know
Not afraid to show, I just wanna say

From my head to my toes
Feeling overexposed
I wanna be naked with you
All my faults, all your scars
Who I am, who you are
I wanna be oh, naked with you, naked with you


No more lies, no more hate
No more waiting in the wings
Take my hand, take this danger
I just wanna say

From my head to my toes
Feeling overexposed
I wanna be naked with you
All my faults, all your scars
Who I am, who you are
I wanna be oh, naked with you, naked with you
