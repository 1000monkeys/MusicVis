Can I get a little more time?
I need to unravel my lines
Oh I'll stay frozen in one place
Wake me up when it's okay

Things get smaller by the day
By the day

I sing
I wanna live forever, oh
I wanna live forever, oh
Don't turn the lights out, I can't see
Don't turn the lights out on me
'Cause I want to live forever

Oh god, I'm feeling it now
My song is worth slowing down
I'll get on my knees and pray
There's nobody in my way

Things get smaller by the day
By the day, oh

I wanna live forever, oh
I wanna live forever, oh
Don't turn the lights out, I can't see
Don't turn the lights out on me
'Cause I want to live forever

If I could buy a little more time
All my wrongs could be right
I could find the love of my life
I just need a little more time
Oh, hey

I wanna live forever, oh
I wanna live forever, oh
Don't turn the lights out, I can't see
Don't turn the lights out on me
I wanna live forever

(Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever)
Don't turn the lights out, I can't see
(Forever, forever)
Don't turn the lights out on me
(Forever, forever)
Don't turn the lights out, I can't see
(Forever, forever)
Don't turn the lights out on-
