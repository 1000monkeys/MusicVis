It doesn't feel right with you gone
It hurts too much to be left alone
I know I was never in your plans
But it doesn’t feel right in her bed (But I love it)
It hurts to know
[Verse 1: Witt Lowry & 
Deion Reverie
]
Yeah, if only I knew to love you, I would lose me
Would wake up just to go back asleep
I hope you and him live happily
But the memories, girl, you gon' have to keep
All the lies that you told me are on repeat
I don't know what’s real, you lie through your teeth
If I could take the feelings that I had for you
Just like our pics, I'd press delete
I've been contemplatin' a hundred times
About a hundred facts I found out were lies
I know you used me just to pass the time
But you can never say I didn't fucking try
What you meant to me is what I mean to art
Was real with you from the fuckin' start
You played games with my fuckin' heart
And after you, I fell a-fuckin'-part, damn
I know we weren’t perfect, I guess I thought we were worth it
I guess your love was uncertain, you’re busy at the club flirtin'
Friends just keep feedin’ you bourbon
Car smellin' like his cologne and your weed
For months I would think, "Is he better than me?"
I know that he can't love you better than me
I wonder, was it you intention to cheat?
Can't believe I believed you
Keep telling myself I don’t need you
When talking to her, I just see you
Alone, but surrounded by people
Maybe one day you'll change, and he'll reap the benefits
'Cause all you left me were questions and pain
Don't know why I care if you're feelin' the same
I need to just get you up out of my brain 
(It hurts to know)
[Pre-Chorus: Witt Lowry & 
Deion Reverie
]
I know I was never the plan
You're not the you you would claim
You're not the person I met
Don't know the you you became
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still 
(It hurts to know)
And I tried to give you a chance
But things were never the same
I ended up all alone
You ended up with a lame
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still 
(It hurts to know)

It doesn't feel right with you gone
It hurts too much to be left alone
I know I was never in your plans
But it doesn't feel right in her bed
It hurts to know
[Verse 2: Witt Lowry &

Still, you're who my family adores
Maybe that's why it's hard to ignore you
After all of the time that we spent
Sad to think that I still didn't know you
Woke up in a city that we've never been to
I wish I could show you
Even my music, I put it below you
Just know I woulda done anything for you (
It hurts to know
)
Remember I told you I felt inadequate
Because you came from a family with money
And me, I have nothing, I work as a waiter
With visions of turning myself into something
The music was buzzing, but I couldn't pay for a bill
Off of people just saying they love it
Had class in the morning, had work in the evening
Then write through the night with no food in my stomach (
It hurts to know
)
Just know that it's hard
Damn, girl, it's so fucking hard
I keep tellin' myself that I need to move on
But it's hard to get close when you have up a guard
I know everything changed, the old me would prolly feel shame
For the bottles I've bought on my card
You would go to the bar while I was stuck working the double
To pay for the tank in my car (
It hurts to know
)
And I guess that it's best I pretend like I don't give a fuck
Even though, to be real, I'm a mess
I've been trying to find anything I can find
Just to fill in the hole in my chest
And it's sad to believe that a picture with me
Is a picture of you and an ex
You should know that it takes everything within me
To delete when I'm sending a text, like

It doesn't feel right with you gone
It hurts too much to be left alone (It hurts to know)
I know I was never in your plans (It hurts to know)
And I ain't just can't get you out my head
It hurts to know
