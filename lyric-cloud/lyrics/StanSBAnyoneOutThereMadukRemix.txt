She's gone, but not for long
She made her choices
And they were wrong
So struggle, all you want
'Cause they won't hear you
They don't care
It's easy
But don't you try
It's a pointless way to die
I don't see you when I open my eyes
I need to be near you
Is anyone out there? 
She just leaves him, but she don't know why
Finds a bottle, to ease her mind
She starts screaming, and she starts to cry
She knows she's alone now
Is anyone out there? 
She remembers, the man she lost
She will find him, whatever the cost
She knows that, the road is long
But she needs him, she don't care
Reunited
Wrong time, wrong place
A tombstone in the rain
No kisses, no embrace
Falls to her knees and there's his faith
It's easy
But don't you try
It's a pointless way to die
I don't see you when I open my eyes
I need to be near you
Is anyone out there?
