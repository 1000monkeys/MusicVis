I need a spirit who can touch my life
I need a voice to speak the truth
I need a soul who will be on my side
I need a heart I'll never lose
Someone like you
Sometimes I wonder if my dreams are wild
Sometimes I know they'll all come true
I need somebody who can move my world
Someone who knows just what to do
Someone like you
Somebody like you
Someone like you x2
