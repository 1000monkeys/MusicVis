(Say what)
I was happy
I was happy for you
Now I'm really I’m really I’m really
(Headheartmalfunction)
Maybe
Maybe it's not an ending
Maybe it's a beginning

Up-shift and the wind in my face
I could use a little time and space
Just broke the hell out of my heart
I press restart, I press restart

I relax my grip
And roll my wrists
Shake loose
I'm like new
So maybe I still notice you in traces
Like in total strangers' faces
Shades of ghosts in my head
That was the ebb, this is the flow
I'd like to let go
(I would like to let go)

Up-shift and the wind in my face
I could use a little time and space
Just broke the hell out of my heart
I press restart, I press restart
Ooh maybe in another dimension
Maybe next time, reincarnation
Just broke the hell out of my heart
I press restart, I press restart

When you're broken at the bottom
And your perfect white is stained
Call us up and let us know
I would like to let go
When you got the love post-mortem
Can't stand another day
Call us up and let us know
I would like to let go

The last chapter in the story of my old self
Damsel in distress
Waiting for a deus ex
In line to be your next ex
What if I don't want to live like that?
Am I just a lab rat
Doing what's done to me
Doesn't sound fun to me
I am not the subject
I am the experiment
I am mad scientist
Invent my way out of this
