One night
One more chance to say i'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me
One night
One more chance to say i'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me
With a white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
With a white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
One night
One night
Say you need me
One night,i surrender
One night,one night,one night,one night...
With a white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
With a white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me
One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me
One night,one night,one night,one night...
