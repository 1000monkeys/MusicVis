One of my friends just got into jail
But I'm bout to bail him out so I can take him to the club
I'm gonna splash, got these friends got these drank
Got these drugs got this sex all up in my denim pants
At this afterparty I see all these zombies
Man these people tripping, trippy as hell
I woke up next to three girls, think I left my pants, yeah
Finna call my plug, and do it all again

I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka all these drugs set me free
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka save a cat from a tree
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka all these drugs set me free
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka save a cat from a tree

I can't dance I just mixed up all these things
I saw on the internet with my laptop on my lap
Bitch my life a meme and my reddit game mean
Let me pull up in de scene, spoderman in your jeans
All my diamonds glistening, baby are you listening
Telling you the truth I flip pancakes like the best
I slide through on a horse, like a Polish knight
On my way to steal your girl and do it all again

I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka all these drugs set me free
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka save a cat from a tree
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka all these drugs set me free
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka save a cat from a tree

I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka all these drugs set me free
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka save a cat from a tree
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka all these drugs set me free
I'm the ba-ba-ba-bazooka save a cat from a tree
