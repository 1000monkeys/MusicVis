I was talking to myself
I belonged to someone else
Can... can you tell me who's who?
I'll give you a clue

Follow me
'Cause I know you want to play
Follow me
Don't you know I came to slay?

They look just like each other
He was something like a brother
You... {I don't know your face?}
I'll show you the way

Follow me
Don't you know I came to slay?
Follow me
'Cause I know you want to play
Sign the deal
Believe me when I say
Don't you know I came to slay?
To slay

I've had a dream
You followed me, you made me feel alive
I've had a dream
And I'm so glad to have you by my side
Oh yeah
I've had a dream...

And it's turning out exactly as I planned
I've had a dream...
And I've got you eating out the palm of my hand
I've had a dream...
You can take it back, I'm taking what is mine
I've had a dream...
I'll be right here until the end of time

Follow me
Don't you know I came to slay?
Follow me
'Cause I know you want to play
I've had a dream
Believe me when I say
Don't you know I came to slay?
To slay
