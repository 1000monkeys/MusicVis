I cross my heart 'cause it keeps me safe
There's too many sinners and not enough saints
And where I'm from people don't wear capes
No superhero is gonna save the day

And if these tears should fall and break some ground
May the sun come up and dry it out
'Cause the world's in need of love right now
And it don't feel too safe, day by day

My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled

Day by day, my heart is
My heart is troubled (troubled)
My heart is
My heart is troubled

Love my town and I love my city
It might be clichÃ©, but it sure ain't pretty
If we wanna see change, we gotta change our minds
Stop sitting around here wasting time

And if these tears should fall and break some ground
May the sun come up and dry it out
'Cause the world's in need of love right now
And it don't feel too safe, day by day

My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled

Day by day, my heart is
My heart is troubled (troubled)
My heart is
My heart is troubled

And if these tears should fall and break some ground
May the sun come up and dry it out
'Cause the world's in need of love right now
It don't feel too sane, day by day

My heart is troubled (troubled)
My heart is troubled (troubled)
My heart is troubled (troubled)
Troubled

Day by day, my heart is
Troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
Troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
My heart is troubled, troubled, troubled, troubled
Troubled, troubled, troubled

My heart is troubled
