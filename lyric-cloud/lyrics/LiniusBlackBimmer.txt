Black Bimmer, feel my blood simmer
Black Bimmer, front stars glimmer
Not a silver, got myself a winner
Black Bimmer, Black Bimmer

I been feelin’ so emotional now, got my heartbeat racing through the streets of my town
Got that champagne poppin’ and I’m going in wild, when I gotta hit the gas ain’t no time for a countdown
No judgement, I just do my own thing, don’t need opinions ridin’ in my own lane
You better check me cuz I ain’t got no brakes, better strap up cause we’re doing it in my way
Got a Black Bimmer ready for departing
Road’s shakin’ when I be starting
Revvin’ up all the opps be startling
Four point four V8 bombarding
Got them lights they be flashin’ like stars
Come around know my thing is up to par
Hit the switch and we’re going in far
Sixth gear pedalling I’m taking you to Mars, ay
