Starless sky
We've got so good at pretending there's a side
A side to you that isn't running
But I don't know where it is that you've been hiding
But I need you tonight

'Cause I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade, but I won't let them
Oh, I'm holding onto heaven
When I breathe, it's only you 
(you...)


I can't take it
'Cause you think nobody sees what you're doing to me
I'm telling you, guilt is in your eyes
I hate what you've done, what you've made me become
No sleep to face the night

'Cause I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade, but I won't let them
Oh, I'm holding onto heaven
When I breathe, it's only you


'Cause I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade, but I won't let them
Oh, I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade, but I won't let them
