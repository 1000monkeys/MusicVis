I hear the echo out there on the street
It's rising up just like a fever dream
Cuts like a dagger when I try to breathe
The engine's cranking on your war machine
You think you got me but you're in too deep
You dropped your match into the gasoline

The time is now
Going kamikaze
Won't back down
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
But your army can't bring me down
Almost there, you better know
That this is your last breath

You can bring your army
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
But your army can't bring me down

There is no king on me, a cheap disguise
Yeah with the secret hiding in his eyes
We won't be silent hear our voices rise

The time is now
Going kamikaze
Won't back down
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
But your army can't bring me down
Almost there, you better know
That this is your last breath

You can bring your army
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
But your army can't bring me down

Until the war is over
We are brothers, not soldiers
Standing shoulder to shoulder
Until the war is over
We are brothers, not soldiers
Standing shoulder to shoulder

The time is now
Going kamikaze
Won't back down
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
But your army can't bring me down
Almost there, you better know
It's your last breath

Going kamikaze on you now
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
You can bring your army
But your army can't bring me down
