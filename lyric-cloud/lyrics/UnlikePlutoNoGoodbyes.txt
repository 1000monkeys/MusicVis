Fame and freedom
Why would we believe them
Day to day is weighing on my mind
Soft oppression built to teach a lesson
My depression driving me away

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes

I don’t wanna risk it
I don’t wanna waste time
I’ma get wasted
I’m gonna get high
Pour another whisky
Pour it 'til it hits me
Probably gonna drown me
Then I’ll finally sleep

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes

I was laying in the gutter
Bruised and bleeding
It’s all in my head
Please relieve me

No goodbyes
