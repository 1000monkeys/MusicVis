Walking blind and my hands are tied
I wanna lose my troubled mind
Out of reach just like the moon
But I will find my way, and I say
(Ooh) Don't need no mercy
(Ooh) What can I do
(Ooh) No need to save me
(Ooh) 'Cause I will find my way to you
(Ooh) Don't need no mercy
(Ooh) What can I do
(Ooh) No need to save me
(Ooh) I will find my way to you
We will make it to the promised land
Oh oh, the promised land
Don't need no mercy
What can I do
No need to save me
I will find my way to you
We will make it to the promised land
Oh oh, the promised land
(Oh oh, the promised land)
(Ooh) Don't need no mercy
What can I do
(Ooh) No need to save me
'Cause I will find my way to you
(Ooh) Don't need no mercy
(Ooh) What can I do
(Ooh) No need to save me
(Ooh) I will find my way to you
Oh oh, the promised land
(We will make it, we will make it)
We will make it to the promised land
Promised land
Don't need no mercy
What can I do
No need to save me
I will find my way to you
