I can taste the teeth dyin' in my mouth
It's a shame, it's a shame, but I'll do it all the same
And your touch is so diseasey, diseasey
And your touch is so diseasey, diseasey

I have kissed your husband on the neck
It was tame, it was tame, but I'd do it all again
And your touch is so diseasey, diseasey
And your touch is so diseasey, diseasey

And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
Same as last time, babe
I won't go home with you
And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
What's coming over me?
Why am I in bed with you?

I'm into your sickness
Infect me with your weakness

And I've heard all about your new bint
I don't care, I don't care, I'll finish her, I swear
And your touch is so diseasey, diseasey
And your touch is so diseasey, diseasey

And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
Same as last time, babe
I won't go home with you
And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
What's coming over me?
Why am I in bed with you?
And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
Same as last time, babe
I won't go home with you
And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
What's coming over me?
Why am I in bed with you?

I'm into your sickness
Infect me with your weakness

And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
Same as last time, babe
I won't go home with you
And I wanna say honestly
You need to let go of me
What's coming over me?
Why am I in bed with you?

I'm into your sickness
With you, with you
Infect me with your weakness
