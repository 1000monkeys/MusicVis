I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

I—I try to consume
Just like a super faggot I get subdued
How can y'all
Bring a motherfucker something so good he couldn't say no
You nailed me hard
I love them when they don't give a motherfucking shit
I could've been someone
Instead of falling flat upon my ass

Dig me now 
and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of, "Faggot, faggot, faggot"
Oh, dig me now 
and fuck me later
And sing it with that

I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

I—I could've been a star
It freaks me out when I sound just like my mom
I could've rocked the spot
Instead of being just another faggot like I am
I played that shit straight
Blowing suckers on the side, hoping I get laid
Now everybody knows
No way in hell I can ever live it down

Dig me now 
and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of, "Faggot, faggot, faggot"
Oh, dig me now 
and fuck me later
And sing it with that

I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

I could've been someone
Instead of falling flat upon my ass

Dig me now 
and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of, "Faggot, faggot, faggot"
Oh, dig me now 
and fuck me later
And sing it with that

I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

Molest
Faggot, faggot, faggot
Faggot, faggot, faggot
Faggot, faggot, faggot
Faggot, faggot, faggot
