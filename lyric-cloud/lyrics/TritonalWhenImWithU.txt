I wish you could inhale me like
The cigarette you gave me
That night in December
Got colder, was frozen
You wrapped your arms around me
I know you remember

We've been on that on and off thing
We can go for weeks no talking
But it's been a month, I'm wondering
No complications, but do you feel like I do?

'Cause when I'm with you
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Everything's cool when I'm with you, when I'm with you
Wanna get loose when I'm with you, when I'm with you
No complications, but do you feel like I do?

(When I'm with you)
(When I'm with you)
Like I do
(When I'm with you, you)
Do you feel like I do?
(When I'm with you)
Like I do
(When I'm with you)
Like I do
No complications, but do you feel like I do?

We've been here for a while now
Feels like it's time to find out
Can we take it further?
Our lips need no distance
Our minds keep on resisting
When we should come closer

We've been on that on and off thing
We can go for weeks no talking (No)
But it's been a month, I'm wondering (Yeah, I'm wondering)
No complications, but do you feel like I do?

'Cause when I'm with you
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Everything's cool when I'm with you, when I'm with you (Yeah)
Wanna get loose when I'm with you, when I'm with you (When I'm with you)
No complications, but do you feel like I do?

(When I'm with you)
(When I'm with you)
Like I do
(When I'm with you, you)
Do you feel like I do?
(When I'm with you)
Like I do
(When I'm with you)
Like I do
No complications, but do you feel like I do?
(Do you feel like I do, I do?) Aah
(When I'm with you, you, yeah)
When I'm with you, yeah, yeah
(Do you feel like I do, I do?)
Like I do
(When I'm with you, you)
When I'm with you
(Yeah, yeah)

We've been on that on and off thing
We can go for weeks no talking
But it's been a month, I'm wondering (I'm wondering)
No complications, but do you feel like I do? (Do you feel like I do?)
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you (Do you feel like I do?)
No complications, but do you feel like I do? (Oh, Lord)
No complications, but do you feel like I do? (Do you feel it?)
No complications, but do you feel like I do? (No complications when I'm with you)

'Cause when I'm with you
When I'm with you, when I'm with you (Oh, Lord)
Everything's cool when I'm with you, when I'm with you (When I'm with you)
Wanna get loose when I'm with you, when I'm with you (Yeah, yeah)
No complications, but do you feel like I do?

Do you feel like I do, I do? (Aah, when I'm with you)
When I'm with you, you, yeah (When I'm with you, yeah, yeah)
Do you feel like I do, I do? (Ooh)
When I'm with you, you, yeah, yeah (When I'm with you)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
