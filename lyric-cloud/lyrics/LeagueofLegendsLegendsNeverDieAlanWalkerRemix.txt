Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die (oo-oh)

They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bonesThey run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die...

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs â€“ the scars collected all their lives (oo-oh)
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Woah, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die...

Woah, when the world is callin' out your name, begging you to fight
Oh, pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh)
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Legends never die...
