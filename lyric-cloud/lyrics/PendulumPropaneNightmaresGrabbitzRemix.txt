Something’s tearing me down
And I, I can’t help but feel it's coming from you
She's a shotgun bride with the trigger cries
I just wonder what we've gotten ourselves into
In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights on the sun

Mind is willing, soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire
Mind is willing, soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire
Bring it on home

Bring it on home, oh oh
Bring it on home, yeah
Bring it on home, oh oh
Bring it on home, yeah you got to
Bring it home

Much too weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from what's below
Much too weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from what's below
Raise the anchor, bring it on home

Bring it on home, oh oh
Bring it on home, yeah
Bring it on home, oh oh
Bring it on home, yeah you got to
Bring it home

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights on the sun
