Now I've forgotten how many sunsets it's been
Since I held the key to that place within her heart
Why does it feel as if I've aged a million years?
When she stings my mind like a childhood memory
Little light of mine
Love that I've lost
Dream the dream that only you and I could see
And if you needed anything, I'd give it all in an instant
Even if you never come back to me
Once the was a time when I could find her
She'd clear the darkness from my mind
It didn't matter who was facing us at night
There was a type of love for only she and I
I wonder how long I've been staring out this window
In the company of good friends who don't know what's wrong with me
Morning comes, and youth continues to vanish from my head
And now I think I'd like to go to bed
Little light of mine
Drifting like the sea
I dreamed a dream for you, although it's so hard to see
And wherever you sleep tonight, I hope it's all you ever wanted
'Cause I know you're never coming back to me
