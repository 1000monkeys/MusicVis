Another command to succumb to sucking you off with a smile
A vanity culture like a congregation
Identity dogmatism, the image is always in style
Stroking the ego with media masturbation
Conditioning to canonize
Gospel of this vox populi
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I want to be the anti you
A singular definition of what it's supposed to be like
An arrogant principle of validation
You're pushing the masochism, we're never to question the hive
I'll be the nemesis of expectation
Refusing to regurgitate
Accuse and excommunicate
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I want to be the anti you
Anti you
This narcissism is a system to intimidate
Perpetuating, overcompensating your self-hate
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I've got nothing to prove
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I want to be the anti you
