Dangerous!
Dangerous!

I'm pulling back the wires
That been holding me up like liars

Step out of my way now
Step out of my way now

I'm coming through the window
Been shaking off all these shadows

Step out of my way now
Step out of my way now

No, we ain't like them
No, no, we ain't like them
Yeah, you're gonna catch us walking on the edge

We be living so
Dangerous
We be living so
Dangerous
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
We be living so
Dangerous
We be living so
Dangerous
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
So dangerous

Sweat running off them teeth now
Like dominoes we just fall down

Step out of my way now
Step out of my way now

I know the streets they've been walking
The language that they've been talking

Step out of my way now
Step out of my way now

No, we ain't like them
No, no, we ain't like them
Yeah, you're gonna catch us walking on the edge

We be living so
Dangerous
We be living so
Dangerous
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
We be living so
Dangerous
We be living so
Dangerous
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
So dangerous

There is no ink on the page
But I still got something to say
Mountains have crumbled today
But we ain't the fallout decay

We ain't like them
No, no, we ain't like them
Yeah, you're gonna catch us walking on the edge
We be living so dangerous

Dangerous
We be living so
Dangerous
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
We be living so
Dangerous
We be living so
Dangerous
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
So dangerous

So dangerous
(We ain't like them)
D-dangerous
(We ain't like them)
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
(We ain't like them)
We be living so dangerous
(No, we ain't like them)
I like how it makes me feel
I like how it makes me feel
So dangerous!
