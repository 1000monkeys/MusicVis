Too good
Ain't it all too good?
Looks like Lady Luck has woken up on the right side
Doing just fine
Get along just fine
I keep waking up afraid to look on the bright side

I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down
I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down

We're OK
Doing A-OK
I feel right as rain, and I can't complain; it's amazing
When I'm getting alright
There's not a cloud in sight
Lifts me off my feet, feels so sweet I can taste it

But I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down
I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down

(I get nervous)
(I get nervous)
(I get nervous) cause what comes up must come down

(I, I, I get) I get nervous (nervous)
(I, I, I get) So, so nervous
(I, I, I get) I get nervous (nervous)
(I, I, I get)

I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down
I get nervous when I'm happy
I get nervous cause what comes up must come down

(I get nervous)
(I get nervous)
(I get nervous) cause what comes up must come down
