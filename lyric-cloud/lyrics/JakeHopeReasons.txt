What the hell, who is this, who am I turning myself into?
It's like every day, every night I'm out of time, with nothing getting through

How can anybody move on like this?
And what's it even matter just to fall without a lift?
What the hell, who is this, what have I been letting myself do?

And I've got a thousand reasons to run and maybe you could be the reason I stay
'Cause I'm sick of feeling numb and maybe you could be the one who saves me, and maybe you could be the one who saves me
And maybe you could be the one who saves me

I look at you, see the way, a better place, salvation from the state I'm in
It's all I want, all I need, set me free from all the things I've never been

How can anybody move on like this?
And what's it even matter just to fall with out a lift?
I look at you, see the way, a better place, salvation and some truth

And I've got a thousand reasons to run and maybe you could be the reason I stay
'Cause I'm sick of feeling numb and maybe you could be the one who saves me, and maybe you could be the one who saves me
And maybe you could be the one who saves me
