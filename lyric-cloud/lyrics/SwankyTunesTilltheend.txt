What you're waiting for
What I'm looking for
You can find it's around you
Where you came from
Where you belong
The way you go is destiny of your own
The way you go is destiny of your own
The way you go is destiny of your own
Do you believe in your own dreams?
You can greet the life you want to live
Don't be afraid, just take my hand
Together we can make it till the end
Together we can make it till the end
Together we can make it till the end
Together we can make it till the end
Together we can make it till the end
Together we can make it till the end
Together we can make it till the end (Till the end)
Together we can make it till the end (Till the end)
Together we can make it till the end (Till the end)
Together we can make it till the end
