Flying on a free flight
Driving all night with my machinery
'Cause I, I got the power, any hour
To show the man in me
And those reputations blown to pieces with my artillery
While I'll be guiding, we'll be riding
Give a-what you got to me

Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry, 'cause it's your turn, tonight

Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

Like a fever, burnin' faster
You spark the bon in me
Crazy feelings got me reeling
They got me raising steam

Now, don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry, 'cause it's your turn, tonight, yeah

Ow
Cut it!

Let me
Let me
Ow


Let me give it all
Let me give it all to you
To you
Give it all
