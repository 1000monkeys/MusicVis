I'm having thoughts again
Hey, are we more than friends?
Been tryin’ to say those words for days
'Cause I've been noticin’
That when I look at you
You turn your head and look away

Been dancin' 'round the feelin' and the doubt
Can't get it out, why can't you tell me now?

Oh, I've been up all night
Wonderin' why you lie
When your heart’s sayin’ more than you do
I feel it every time
That I look in your eyes
You're hidin’ what I always knew

And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that’s the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth

Those things we could have said
On loop inside my head
It's with me everywhere I go
Might be a mistake
But that's a risk I'll take
If I don't ask, I'll never know

Been dancin' 'round the feeling and the doubt
Can't get it out, why can't you tell me now?

Oh, I've been up all night
Wonderin' why you lie
When your heart's sayin' more than you do
I feel it every time
That I look in your eyes
You're hidin what I always knew

And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth (Truth, ah-ah-ah, truth, ah-ah-ah)
And that's the truth
