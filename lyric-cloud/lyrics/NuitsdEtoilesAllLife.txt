Fell in love on the beach
To the sound of Calvin Harris
And I never thought I'd see your face again
Cause you were going to Paris
You took my hand, saying baby you're mine
Don't worry about a thing, cause we got a long long time

We got all life
And I'm yours tonight
We got all life
So let's live tonight
Don't worry 'bout your problems
Cause I'm here tonight
So just shut your pretty face, and look into my eyes
We got all life
And I'm yours tonight


It's been a long long ride
But we've been holding on tight
Oh look when driving by that bench
Where we used to get high
You said my name, saying baby you're mine
Don't worry about a thing, no
We got a long long time

We got all life
And I'm yours tonight
We got all life
So let's live tonight
Don't worry 'bout your problems
Cause I'm here tonight
So just shut your pretty face, and look into my eyes
We got all life
And I'm yours tonight


But I never stopped thinking
About that night we had
Under the palm trees and pot heads
She looked into my eyes

We got all life
And I'm yours tonight
We got all life
So let's live tonight
Don't worry 'bout your problems
Cause I'm here tonight
So just shut your pretty face, and look into my eyes
We got all life
And I'm yours tonight
We got all life
And I'm yours tonight
We got all life
So let's live tonight
Don't worry 'bout your problems
Cause I'm here tonight
So just shut your pretty face, and look into my eyes
We got all life
And I'm yours tonight

We got all life
We got all life
All life
We got all life
And I'm yuors tonight
