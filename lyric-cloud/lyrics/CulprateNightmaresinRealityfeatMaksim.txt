Nightmares in reality
Like a fucked up dream
Nightmares in reality

I'mma bust bars hard 'til my chest breaks up
Let my lungs get wrecked with the taste of the puff
Trust, I blaze 'nuff green with some real rough teens
Come to my neck of the woods, it's like a fucked dream
Nightmares in reality, and it's really sad to see
Most won't survive when they're stepping to the baddest beat
And if you think that you're different
Put your ear to the speakers and just listen


That's the sound of the beast
Rolling down your street with a blunt and a fat sub
Not a sandwich, I'm talking about vibrations
That'll shake 'em till they can't stand up
Feel your knees get shaky
Vibrate with the bass until your mind gets hazy
Too many zoots is bound to do that
So I'm gonna strap two fat zoots, here, blaze these, HA!

(Nightmares in reality)

Never mind the bass, bruv
You can tell I'd rather blaze a couple 8ths up, standard
FIFA and some bait dubs, they go down a treat
But my conscience is telling me "Bruv, what you're doing is nonsense!"
Where you gonna get if you sit there toking zoots
Staying in the game by a thread, cause I told you
You need to get yourself checked out
Cause your mind is much too wrecked right now
Will not resort to injecting the brown
But still the green's much too much right now
Gotta give that shit a rest so I can digress
And the nightmares don't stay stuck in reality
Might flare up if I keep building up the cheese
Bound to get tough while bringing these rough beats
Watch me come through bussing bars
Leaving the nightmares stuck in the past like my sanity
(Like a fucked up dream)
