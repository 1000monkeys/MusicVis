EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
MASTER CHIEF VS LEONIDAS!
BEGIN!

Spartans, let's start this
Show this petty officer who's the hardest
The biggest mistake that you've ever made
I'll toss you like a frag grenade
I'll stomp you in the face with my sandals, enraged
And tonight we shall rhyme in the shade
Your puny fans are fat nerds on computers
,
Jerking off to games, giving themselves first-person shooters
.
Your armor's hard, but my abs are harder
,
You're in my hood now, Chief
, 
This is Sparta!

Not so fast
Cortana says you're Greek
So why don't you stick these lyrics up your ass
They built a monument to my sins
You're the soldier they need you to be
Ain't no way that you can beat me
Even my initials spell M.C
While you and your companions were all camping in a canyon
Took a campaign to your house
 and showed 
your queen
 my 
plasma cannon
They shoulda thrown your rhymes over the cliff because they're sickly
You will not enjoy this, but it will be over quickly

Ha! I've had better battles with my six-year-old son
I don't need firepower when I'm rockin these guns
I'm King, you sleep in a freezer in outer space
I'd look you in the eyes, but you're too much of a bitch to show your face!

You've got a bad case of no shirt there, Fabio Flintstone
.
Your whole plan got messed up by a hunchback with down syndrome
300 asses needed kicking,
 
give more teabags than Lipton
So why don't you quit your bitching
, 
my trigger finger's itching
WHO WON? WHO'S NEXT? YOU DECIDE!
