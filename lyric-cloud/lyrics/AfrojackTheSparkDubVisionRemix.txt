A little bit of misfit dancing
A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine
Coming out the mind of this midnight rambler
I can't wait 'til these tunes of mine
Get me out of this local jam
Let's get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever thank you if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, right
Clashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm telling everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Taking back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
They say if you look around
For something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down
But Shawty don't be blinded
Feeling trap thinking you can't get out of
This summer drum scene
Time to time you stay upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, right
Clashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm telling everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Taking back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
