I'm out here looking for you, where you at?
Burning late at night to get you back
I know I fucked up, and that's a fact
I was just tryna do me, tryna succeed, but this music
I know, I spend too much time in the studio
I know, you don't support that shit
But I need you in my life, that's why I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you

I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
Right now
Right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now

My mind is searching for you once again
Checking all the places you go with your friends
And I know, I need you here and not to make amends
I don't want to hear nothing on a rooftop thinking 'bout you
I spend too much time getting faded
These other women: they too complicated, yeah I know
It's you I wanna spend my every day with, that's why I'm looking for you

I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
Right now
Right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
I'm looking for you right now
