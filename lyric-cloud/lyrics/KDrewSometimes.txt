Sometimes we might fall
And turn our backs when we're against the wall
And even if we're scared to lose it all
Don't hide (don't hide)
Oh even when you can't run then you'll crawl
Though life may burn you till your burial
So if you're ever scared to lose it all
Don't hide

We came too far to let it go
And way too close to lose control
We try to keep what we can't hold (what we can't hold)
There's part of me that's given up
The other side don't give a
They want the weak but that's not us

Sometimes we might fall
And turn our backs when we're against the wall
And even if we're scared to lose it all
Don't hide (don't hide)
Oh even when you can't run then you'll crawl
Though life may burn you till your burial
So if you're ever scared to lose it all
Don't hide
