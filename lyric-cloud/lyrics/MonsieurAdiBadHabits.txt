I feel static in my veins
Every second like slow motion
Every time you walk away
Like if I close my eyes we change
From two strangers in a building
Or some ghost who only fade away

Smoke can clear a crowded room
See I don't want you
See I don't need you
To make it out alive

And I know I got bad habits I should break
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got some secrets I can't shake
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got bad habits I should break
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got some secrets I can't shake
And when the morning comes smoke and clear away

Keep every inch out on display
With a simple conversation
And a moment to erase

Smoke can clear a crowded room
See I don't want you
See I don't need you
To make it out alive

And I know I got bad habits I should break
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got some secrets I can't shake
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got bad habits I should break
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got some secrets I can't shake
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away

Smoke can clear a crowded room
See I don't want you
See I don't need you
To make it out alive

And I know I got bad habits I should break
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got some secrets I can't shake
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got bad habits I should break
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away
And I know I got some secrets I can't shake
And when the morning comes smoke can clear away

See I don't want you
See I don't need you
