In my...
Way...
In myâ€¦

Something in you screams love
You don't know why, you don't know why
When times call for you to let go you're...
Lost in standby, in standby
Something in you dreams love
You don't know why, you don't know why
Mind racing, your heart lays low so...
Lost in standby, in standby

Night skies remind me of heartbreak
I miss the light when you're far away
I think out loud with little to say
I get lost when you're in my way

Night skies remind me of heartbreak
I miss the light when you're far away
I think out loud with little to say
I get lost when you're in my way
