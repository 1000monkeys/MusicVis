Im dreaming why'll awake why'll im dealing with the lames
Peeling woods for the greater good playing different retro games
On the mystic path to cosmic power
Puffing chronic flowers rising out the underground Donatello
With the bandit fellows , running zelda since the Velcros
Got my eagle eye on my forehead Ed Belfour
Walk around the public trying not to fit in by wearing different linens
I always got the spliff lit almost got evicted out my house lots of times
But i dont give  shit because i can still right these rhymes
Thats total wellness to me
Body Mind Mastery
Mos with the classic speech , phrase on the genius shit
Rich got the big brain Jimmy Neutron
Ive been named Steven but that shit all changed all I hear is DaLLY now
Im killing shit side show bob mixed with Anderson Varejao
I dont got a job though this league shits the motive Imma stay focused
Gotta keep toking

As the days go by and the pain gone rise then the pain subsides
Ya i stay high, we know sacrifice the league till the afterlife

Bombing you with improper intense speech mind a weapon conscience long
Barrel you brain dead when that shit squeeze' aware of that media thanks bob mcchesney
I anit the same person no more..i'm a person who explores the unknown and other crazy shit
Can't even summarize it' the summer on the horizon new privacy only me alone in streets the
Moon shining..crafty master craft lines pile in with the rhymes its..mos groggy with time days fly
By i don't seem to notice at times lint in my pocket but still i gotta instant noodle budget hitting
Buds its lovely still i smile but inside i hurt dearly disguised emotions from a kid who barley can keep
A drive..going but still excelling with the rhymes opus....
