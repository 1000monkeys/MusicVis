Was all in the moment, like one in a million
I found you in the stars, with a heart made of glass
But the fire in your eyes, to me electrifies
As you and I collide

We could be safe, we could be alive
We could be free for the first time
It's gotta be here, it's gotta be now, it's gotta be with you
Stand next to me, stand next to me
If you stand next to me, we could be indestructible
Stand next to me, stand next to me
You're everything I need
We could be indestructible

A fragile heart that keeps me warm
A little piece of heaven shining in the storm
If the fires gonna burn it's you that's gonna put me out
And if the rain falls down we'll rise above
Carry you home, carry you through the flood
Carry you through the flood

We could be safe, we could be alive
We could be free for the first time
It's gotta be here, it's gotta be now, it's gotta be with you
Stand next to me, stand next to me
If you stand next to me, we could be indestructible
Stand next to me
Stand next to me, stand next to me
You're everything I need, we could be indestructible
Stand next to me
