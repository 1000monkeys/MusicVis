I wish to give, to take, to make, to shake, I wanna see
It happen
I want to see, to be, the one that plays the game
Without no fears and regrets
I want to know you, better than I know myself
I want to feel the end, and enjoy the consequence
I'm playing the game
The one that will take me to my end
I'm waiting for the rain
To wash who I am
I want to move, to loose, to take the grooves, and to
Give it all back
I want to take the time rewind, and to kick it right
From the start
To be unknown and all alone, lose the kind that are
Behind
To start a new play by myself and to give the best I
Have
I'm playing the game
The one that will take me to my end
I'm waiting for the rain
To wash who I am
