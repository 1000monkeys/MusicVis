Darker than the ocean, deeper than the sea
You've got everything, you got what I need
Touch me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me from this place

Touch me
Touch, babe
Touch me
Touch, babe
You're electric, babe
[Verse 2: Khalid & 
Alina Baraz
]
Covered in your water and I'm feeling like a summer breeze
(
Movin' to the tempo, show me what it takes
)
Submitted under power and you brought me to my knees
(
Speeding up my heartbeat, playing in the flames
)
Use me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me all the way
Take me to outer space

Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe (Move me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe
You're electric
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe (Move me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe
You're electric, babe
[Bridge: Khalid & 
Alina Baraz
]
Whisper in my ear, I'm the only one you're loving on
Take advantage of the moment, you're the only one that I want
Melting like ice on a summer day
Hold me like you mean, take me far away

Touch me
Touch, babe
Touch me
Touch, babe
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe (Move me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe
You're electric
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe (Move me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Touch, babe
You're electric, babe
[Outro: Khalid & 
Alina Baraz

Take me to outer space
You're electric, babe
