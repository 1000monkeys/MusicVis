Standing in the moment, waiting for the end
This gonna be a lesson, come around and vent
Everyday I wonder, looking for a thrill
Can you hear the thunder?, rolling down the hill

I can't breath unless you
Look at me and follow
I can't breath unless you
Look at me

Are you satisfied?
With your life
Will you love at night?
Do you feel alright?
Can you hear the thunder?
Rolling down the hill
Are you satisfied?, are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?
With your life
Will you love at night?
Do you feel alright?
Can you hear the thunder?
Rolling down the hill
Are you satisfied?, are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?, ooh
Are you satisfied?, uuh
Are you satisfied?, ooh
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?
With your life
Will you love at night?
Do you feel alright?
Can you hear the thunder?
Rolling down the hill
Are you satisfied?, are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?
