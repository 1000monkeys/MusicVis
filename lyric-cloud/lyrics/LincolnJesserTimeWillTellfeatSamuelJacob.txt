How far would you take a lie
If it did you right to leave 'em high and dry
How long until you're satisfied
Been cheating all your life, does it cross your mind?
You don't ever stop to think about it
Hide your shame and you'll forget about it
How long until you're satisfied
Until you make it right, does it cross your mind?

Time will tell me if I'm right about it
So I'll just chill and let you think about it
Time will tell me if I'm right about it
If I'm right about it, if I'm right about it

Time will, time will tell me if I'm right about it
Time will...tell me if I'm right about it
Time will, time will tell me if I'm right about it
Time will...tell me if I'm right about it

How far would you take a lie
If it did you right to leave 'em high and dry
How long until you're satisfied
Been cheating all your life, does it cross your mind?
Couldn't be forward, couldn't be honest
Could it be I'm just the same?
Wouldn't be my first, could it be I'm just
Looking for someone to blame?

Time will tell me if I'm right about it
So I'll just chill and let you think about it
Time will tell me if I'm right about it
If I'm right about it, if I'm right about it
Time will tell me if I'm right about it
So I'll just chill and let you think about it
Time will tell me if I'm right about it
If I'm right about it, if I'm right about it

Time will, time will tell me if I'm right about it
Time will...tell me if I'm right about it

Time will tell me if I'm right about it
So I'll just chill and let you think about it
Time will tell me if I'm right about it
If I'm right about it, if I'm right about it

Time will, time will tell me if I'm right about it
Time will...tell me if I'm right about it
