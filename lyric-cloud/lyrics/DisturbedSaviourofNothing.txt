Now you've become
Everything you claimed to fight
Through your need to feel you're right
You're the savior of nothing now

When you were a young one, they tormented you
They could always find a way to make you feel ashamed
Now that you are older, everything they put you through
Left you with an anger that just cannot be contained

So you spend every day of your life
Always searching for something to set you on fire

Now you've become
Everything you claimed to fight
Through your need to feel you're right
You're the savior of nothing now

Everywhere around you, you find reasons to
Turn into a warrior to protect what you believe
But you think their beliefs make them less than you
And that is a delusion that your sickness has conceived

Now you spend every day of your life
Always hoping that something will spark the desire

Now you've become
Everything you claimed to fight
Through your need to feel you're right
You're the savior of nothing now

Now you've become
Everything you claimed to fight
Through your need to feel you're right
You're the savior of nothing now
You've become
Everything you claimed to fight
Through your need to feel you're right
You're the savior of nothing now
