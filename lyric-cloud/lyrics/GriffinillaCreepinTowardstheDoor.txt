They keep creepin towards the door
My stomach twists like a worm beneath the lure
My heart beat skips like a phonograph
Old machines weren't built to last
But they keep creepin towards the door...
They keep creepin towards the door
Their bodies reek like they're carrying a corpse
Their footsteps creak as they circle in and the power's running thin but they creepin towards the door
The Phone guy tells me that there is no danger
But i suspect that things will get much stranger
Something about this room is hypnotizing, paralyzing, TERRIFYING!
They keep creepin towards the door
My backbone shakes like a tremor on the floor
My knee caps quake
Why don't i just scram?!
OR UNPLUG THAT STUPID FAN?! Cause they keep creepin towards the door
These furry?phonies masquerade like they're cute
The kids don't notice cause they think they're cartoons
Oh don't look now, i think that Freddy's en route, deadly pursuit, SWEATY FURSUIT!
