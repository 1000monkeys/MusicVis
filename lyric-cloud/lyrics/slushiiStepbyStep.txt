Step by step, take my day
I can see it in your eyes
Step by step, take my day
I see through your disguise

I wanna get away
Where the world can't touch me, no, no, no
I wanna find my place
In your arms, here I go, go, go

Step by step, take my day
I can see it in your eyes
Step by step, take my day
I see through your disguise

I wanna get away
Where the world can't touch me, no, no, no
I wanna find my place
In your arms, here I go, go, go
