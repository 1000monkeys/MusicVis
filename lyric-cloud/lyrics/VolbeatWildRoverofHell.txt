Driving the highway with nothing to do
Future fading away
The stereo pumping Metallica tunes
Ride the lightning, oh yeah
The car might be stolen, my clothes smell like dirt
Born to ramble and play
Play with fire, drunk and denial
Always in for a fight

I've been in the dark side of town
They're bringing me in
They call me the Wild Rover of Hell
I´m fighting for nickels and
A dime for the rules, I always break
See all the blood I've spilled, I'll still be the haunted

Stitching my wounds like Rambo, for fanden
Damage complete and done
Some had the better and some had the worse
Walk a mile in quicksand
Spending the last buck on whiskey and beers
Oh, how clever I am
The dice keep on tumbling, my will still unbroken
But how long will it last

I've been in the dark side of town
They're bringing me in
They call me the Wild Rover of Hell
I´m fighting for nickels and
A dime for the rules, I always break
See all the blood I've spilled, I'll still be the haunted

I'm fighting them all, big or small, my friend
Just show me the dollars
I end up losing it all again
Repeating the story

Driving the highway with nothing to do
Future fading away
The stereo pumping Metallica tunes
Ride the lightning, oh yeah
The car might be stolen, my clothes smell like dirt
Born to ramble and play
Play with fire, drunk and denial
Always in for a fight

I've been in the dark side of town
They're bringing me in
They call me the Wild Rover of Hell
I´m fighting for nickels and
A dime for the rules, I always break
See all the blood I've spilled, I'll still be the haunted
