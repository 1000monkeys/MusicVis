I’m rising up to take the crown
But selfish tears just hold me down
I won’t succumb my weary bones
Are crying out to take me home
Whoa
Press on to reach the summit
Whoa
But I might fall and plummet
Hope I don’t run out of time
To take hold of what’s mine
Lost in the middle of the climb
Running out of time
Seeking out what’s mine
Can you hear the call?
The sound of recollected thought
Will I lose it all?
Or will it be the one to take me home?
Purpose gone
All I know is pain?
What’s the reason?
Do I run in vain?
I’m bearing down, the end is close
My eyes consume the lethal dose
My mind enthralled with crazy dreams
I take the crown that glints and gleams
Hope I don’t run out of time
To take hold of what’s mine
Darkness tears up my mind
Running out of time
Taking back what’s mine
Can you hear the call?
The sound of recollected thought
Will I lose it all?
Or will it be the one to take me home
A broken boy
Dismantled plans
He holds the crown
With shrivelled hands
