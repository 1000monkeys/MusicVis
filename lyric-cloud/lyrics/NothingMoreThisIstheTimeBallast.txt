When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brothers' throats

You can't see because you don't know
You're caught below, beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside, half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind, identify
Do you feel, do you feel?
Do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score
We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes we're walking blind

Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cell
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun



Naked we come, naked we leave
Fools we are, to hold tightly
We are free, we are free
(We are the jail, we are the key) x2

This is the time that we let it go
Yeah, these are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we just open our eyes

This is the time that we let it go
And this is the pain we are forced to know
Singing the song that's inside, inside us all
Inside us all
Walking blind
