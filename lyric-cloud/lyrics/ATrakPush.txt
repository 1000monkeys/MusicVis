Let down, a light that flickers off in the basement
Let down, tonight I feel my courage breaking
I made a mess of easy stuff
I care too much, don't care enough
I wrestle with my attitude
You're mad at me, I'm tired of you
(Chorus)
And it's a horrible thing to push, push, push, push love away
Yeah it's a horrible thing to push, push, push, push love away
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby, just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby, just think, to be
Let down, I feel your disconnect emotion
L
et down, you stand there cold and proud like I'm not your man
And I feel trapped, and gave my word
Not to hang out with other girls
I made you feel like I'm all yours
But I can't stop myself on tours
(Chorus)
It's such a horrible thing to push, push, push, push love away
Yeah it's a horrible thing to push, push, push, push love away
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
It's such a horrible thing to push, push, push, push love away
Yeah it's a horrible thing to push, push, push, push love away
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
Baby, be with you, baby,Baby, be with you, baby just think, to be
