(Go, go)
(Let go)
Let go
(Side, side)

It's like falling asleep
With your eyes wide open
Kind of broken
Caught a blink of them seas
But I tried to hold on my emotion

Blurry dreaming tonight, just because it feels right
(Feels right, feels right, feels right)
Jelly beam and moonlight, take me to the dark side
(Side, side, side)
Let go

(Let go)
(Let go)

No words on the sheet
To be left unspoken
Time is frozen
I forgot how it feels
My path is chosen
Doors are closing

Blurry dreaming tonight, just because it feels right
(Feels right, feels right, feels right)
Jelly beam and moonlight, take me to the dark side
(Side, side, side)
Let go

(Let go)
Let go
(Let go)

(Let)
Let go
(Let)
Let go
(Let)
Let go

Blurry dreaming tonight, just because it feels right
(Feels right, feels right, feels right)
Jelly beam and moonlight, take me to the dark side
(Side, side, side)
Let go

(Let go)
Let go
(Let go)
