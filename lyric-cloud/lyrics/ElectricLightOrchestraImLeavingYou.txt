Golden days, drift into the haze
And times gone by, when days were so young
Now those days, have all slipped away
You think you're going to leave me, all on my own
You're leaving me, you're leaving me
But just before you go, there's something you should know
I've found somebody new, and I'm leaving you
Golden times, roll across my mind
And then they fly away, into the night
New day's gone, and I see it won't
I will remember you looking away from it all
But just before you go, there's something you should know
I've found somebody new, and I'm leaving you
Leaving you, leaving you
