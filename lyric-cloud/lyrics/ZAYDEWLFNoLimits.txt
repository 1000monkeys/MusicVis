The day is coming like a pistol, that's aiming at my brain
The way ya' shining like a crystal, makes me forget the pain
It's do or die, it's do or die, a battle cry, a battle cry

Don't stop, keep going, don't stop, keep going
Don't stop, keep going, don't stop, keep going

No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (boom)
No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (boom)
No limits

I've been walking tall lately, nobody can hold me down
Things are moving like crazy, no, nothing can stop me now
I'm dreaming it, I'm dreaming it, I'm living big, I'm living big

Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going
Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going

No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (boom)
No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (boom)
No limits

No limits, no limits
Can't hold me back, I'm all in it
No limits, no limits
No dream is too big not to finish

Don't stop, keep going, don't stop, keep going

Yeah, no limits
No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (we're taking it all)
No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (we're taking it)
We're taking it all (we're taking it all, we're taking it all)
No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (it's do or die)
No limits, no limits (boom)
We're taking it all, (boom) we're taking it all (taking it all)
No limits
