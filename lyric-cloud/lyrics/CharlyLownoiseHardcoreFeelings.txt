Here we go again!
Do that thing!
Do that thing!
Do that thing!
Come, show me your hardcore feelings with your raving meanings
'Cause I don't know the way to groove
And I've never learned to dance this fast
And I don't know how to move
The beat's kicking hard and the beat's kicking low
Okay, I think that it's unique
But I rather like to dance with you
Like we did cheek to cheek
(Here we go, here we go, here we go again)
Come, show me your hardcore feelings with your raving meanings
'Cause I don't know the way to groove
And I've never learned to dance this fast
And I don't know how to move (Do that thing, do that thing)
The beat's kicking hard and the beat's kicking low
Okay, I think that it's unique
But I rather like to dance with you
Like we did cheek to cheek
(Here we go again)
Do that thing!
Do that thing!
Come show me your hardcore feelings with your raving meanings
From the bottom of your soul
Hardcore feelings with raving meanings
I feel I'm gonna lose control (Do that thing, do that thing!)
The beat's kicking hard and the beat's kicking low
Would you give me one more chance?
Hardcore feelings with raving meanings
'Cause I feel I like to dance
Nanana...
