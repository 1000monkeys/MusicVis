(Verse 1)
Fire up the flames
I'll do you damage
Instagram the blaze
I'm Shere Khan savage
(Chorus)
You don't have to ask
You know I have it
No you don't have to ask
I goddamn have it
Stone Cold Classic
Classic
(Verse 2)
AKA's the name
Got blind ambition
Baddest in the game
With Van Gogh vision
(Chorus)
You don't have to ask
You know I have it
No you don't have to ask
I goddamn have it
Stone Cold Classic
Classic
(Bridge)
Hey
I gotta tell ya
Hey
I gotta tell ya
Hey
If I repeat it, maybe I'll believe it
(Chorus)
You don't have to ask
You know I have it
No you don't have to ask
I god damn have it
Stone Cold Classic
Classic
Stone Cold
Stone Cold Classic
