Yeah
169
Lets go
Came from the struggle to above all
We move like life is a hustle
We came up from societies rubble
They try to break us down, its the little things like when a yute in school gets in trouble
And they put the bad kids in a huddle
And if you ain't on the systems wave
Then your just stuck in a puddle (yeah)
Plus things at home they’re not easy
So it feels like with life and school you gotta juggle
And if your out here its a jungle
So if you don’t pass your test at a certain age I have fuck all
Unless you got links with your uncle
What you doin retake in the same system that put you in the stuggle
And then there’s work where you can get minimum wage for trading time for a number
Now you tell me what that sums up
Remember primary, heads down thumbs up?
If you don’t get chosen then tough luck
But your boys telling you “come bruv”
Fuck that, mans not dumb bruv
See man can grab stuff for one price
Sell dat and we double up nicely
We can buy whips and we can cop ice
About we can’t eat, man would have enough rice
And if man tries a ting, we will cash yutes with a nut slice
Show you the cake and then you wanna have a slice
And now your inside
This is one sign of the ride
Now imagine a next yute in school
He didn’t care about work, he just cared about keeping it cool
All you need is one person in that establishment to tell them all the rules
Tell them our life can be cruel
Tell them our time will go fast
Tell them of the times that won’t last
If they wanna elevate they gotta get that grass
Learning it don’t stop in the class
Man they just tryna give you them basics
How bout we find your potentials
We get your skills and we raise it
Empower yourself with your praising
So what your not good at equations
So what your not smart and your asian
So what your not sporty and African
Don’t let em put you in a box like an applicant
Don’t think this shit is an accident
Because there’s private schools for the affluent
And then there’s public schools for the other class
And your language there be made fluent
But if your English ain't good then your not on par
Who put these mans brain in a jar
Like how’s their understanding so far
Same people who made us leave Europe
Don’t care about how life gets hard
Peoples background and their past
They don’t want us together and that’s a task
Divide and conquer that’s the objective, but
That’s a little bit of my prospective
Saying we that Christmas is festive
Or the same way diamonds are on wedding rings
Control a perception and never anything
They make their own rules if it ever benefits
They care more about how they selling things
Than actually standing up and saying that enough is enough
Why are we not equal as blood
Mans why is there poverty, war, drugs
Man I don’t know man its fucked is that change gna come?
Till then I’m tryna grind for my mum, for my bro, for my brother, for my bruddas, everyone
Me I fight for the right, do you get it till im gone
Its deeper than the vice that im spreading in the songs
Still most of this shit that they telling you is wrong
Design the designer
Trap mash
Mad stacks
Fat backs
Its all nice when your on
What about you?
What about where you are from?
Your experiences?
See it maybe inspire a next don, like
Yh man come from the streets but
How bout we use that greaze to show yutes in beef that is long, that life’s deeper than the block
Like really you’ve never seen a Glock
Like really your tryna get out the ends
Don’t waste that chance tryna stunt with your friends
Beca’ time flies by, it’ll fuck with your head
You gotta make the right choice
So watch where you step, fuck what you rep
The worlds way bigger than the set
Coz really you can hang with the rest
Or you work on yourself and get back what you invest
Trust me you don’t wanna be looking back with regret
Its an opinion but there’s a couple facts that I said
And its all from a rack in my chest, uh
