When your nights are good and colder
And you're looking for someone
When it feels like love is over
I'll hold you in my arms
Baby, I could be a shoulder
I could give you what you want
When you need someone to understand
I'll hold you in my arms

I'll hold you in my, hold you in my, hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my, hold you in my, hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my, hold you in my, hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my arms
(When you need somebody, when you need somebody, when you need somebody I'll hold you in my arms)

When it's harder to remember (remember)
Feels the nature happy wounds
Baby, I've been here forever
I'll hold you in my arms
When you're walking down that long road
And you're too tired to carry on
When you need someone to understand
I'll hold you in my arms

I'll hold you in my, hold you in my, hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my, hold you in my, hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my, hold you in my, hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my arms
(When you need somebody, when you need somebody, when you need somebody I'll hold you in my arms
I'll hold you in my arms)
