Hit rewind, time to melt your... go!
Horrible circle breaks, then worship the freaks
The dog is barking mad, has gone and run away with no leash
The heat is coming, stop running, leave your blood on the streets
We stick together, stormy weather, we don't fuck with police
Go!
You bet you can't hold me down
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire, we fight fire with fire
We fight fire, we fight
(Motherfucking face)
Valiant troops, camouflage my soul if I cry
They don't give a shit whether you live or you die
Feel the heat and prepare for war
Raise your fist and reverse the war
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire, we fight fire with fire
We fight fire, we fight
(Motherfucking face)
