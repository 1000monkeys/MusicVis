I want a wrecking ball
I want to break it all
I want to jump the track
Fade the day to black
It's in the element
In the element
Is what they meant
And the world is bent
Give me something to believe in (believe in)
A drop of hope to raise our fists up high
Blood fills our lungs from screaming (screaming)
We won't live a lie
Won't live a lie
This life is but a dream
So wake me up
'Cause I must be dreaming
I can't believe what my eyes are seeing
Yeah, wake me up
I can't find a meaning
Nothing really matters
When the world is sinking
Down, down, down
When it all falls
Down, down, down
Who will you blame?
I want to do what I'm not
I want to care a lot
I want to stop your fall
I want to take it all
It's never Heaven sent
Never heaven sent
And what they meant
Never made a dent
Give me something to believe in (believe in)
A drop of hope to raise our fists up high
Blood fills our lungs from screaming (screaming)
We won't live a lie
Won't live a lie
This life is but a dream
So wake me up
'Cause I must be dreaming
I can't believe what my eyes are seeing
Yeah, wake me up
I can't find a meaning
Nothing really matters
When the world is sinking
Down, down, down
When it all falls
Down, down, down
Who will you blame?
Trust is breached
We're misunderstood
We try to find our way
But we're falling (down)
Nothing to hold on to (down)
No one there to catch you (down)
And I could never lie to you
I said we're fucking falling (down)
Nothing to hold to (down)
No one there to catch you (down)
And I know you'd never lie (down)
Give us something to believe in
Believe in
Believe in
This life is not a dream
So wake me up
'Cause I must be dreaming
I can't believe what my eyes are seeing
Yeah, wake me up
I can't find a meaning
Nothing really matters
When the world is sinking
Down, down, down
When it all falls
Down, down, down
When it all falls
Down, down, down
Who will you blame?
