Late night, calling up the digital doctor
Doctor impostor
Know what you want so
Just take what he offers

Cure me of my thoughts unclean
Block my favorite happy place
Tell the truth, are you of age
Or just too far gone to be saved

Home invasion, tailor-made
Two components, master-slave
In a moment, plant the seed
Like the Trojan, wait and see

I wanna feel you close to me
I wanna hear you beg and plead
I want to see you sick for me
A new kind of love, no remedy
No remedy

A curious case, a reckless infection
Infected complexion
It's a statewide inspection
It's auto-correction

Fails, bombs, dropped in the middle of downtown
Down from the digital cloud
No need to fear the rain
You're just too far gone to be saved

Home invasion, tailor-made
Two components, master-slave
In a moment, plant the seed
Like the Trojan, wait and see

I wanna feel you close to me
I wanna hear you beg and plead
I want to see you sick for me
A new kind of love, no remedy
No remedy

Late night, calling up the digital doctor
Doctor impostor
Take what he offers
Take what he offers

Home invasion, tailor-made
Two components, master-slave
In a moment, plant the seed
Like the Trojan, wait and see

I wanna feel you close to me
I wanna hear you beg and plead
I want to see you sick for me
A new kind of love, no remedy
I wanna feel you close to me
I wanna hear you beg and plead
I want to see you sick for me
A new kind of love, no remedy

In a moment, plant the seed
Like the Trojan, wait and see
A new kind of love, no remedy
