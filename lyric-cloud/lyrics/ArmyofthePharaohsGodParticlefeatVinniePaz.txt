Back to the hardcore!
Back to the hardcore!
Back to the hardcore!
Back to the hardcore!

Intelligent infinity,
 
malevolent epitome
They consider me as the most deadly weapon from Italy
That'll include the Benelli semi-auto artillery
Literally cryogenically treated to be invisibly
Symphony slicker than sixty Sicilianos from Sicily
Motherfuckers talkin' but never gonna do shit to me
I'm about to set it on motherfuckers officially
Rip they spine out and just put 'em out of they misery
No more mister nice guy, everything maliciously
Who can stop me now you with Luca Brasi where fishes be
It's impossible that you're righteous without the dignity
If it's a problem you motherfuckers can come and visit me

Super humanity gradually back from my galaxy
Burning them calories, I'm still yearnin' to earn a salary
The son of anarchy,
 
I'm in court pleadin' insanity
Can it be all the panicking and agony that's trappin' me?
Tragically introducin' you rappers to tragedy
Happily ever after if after means you a casualty
Praise those who savagely sacrifice their reality
Bury bones and annually dig 'em up unhappily
Catch me, flossin' dead in the center of gravity
Bonafide,
 a mix between 
Maxi Priest
 and the 
Maccabees
My mentality, manipulatin' your mastery
The master, disaster strikes whatever's in back of me

Playtime is over, daytime is over, the finest soldiers
Take nines from holsters
, 
My only weapons: K-9s and Cobras
We diamond poachers, we take your shine,
 we some mind controllers
My rhyme is solar-flarin',
 
airin' out the kind below us
You know Lois Lane
 - know my name
I'm throwin' flames at your brain like Ghost Rider
My flow's tighter, 
I'm Blakey Griffin with an open lane
My foe is Bane,
 
my flow is Betsy Ross off the Zoloft: so insane
I'm over-trained in hand-to-hand and man-to-man my hammers land and can your fam
I'm a brutal rapper, you a Chutes & Ladders
, 
Candyland emcee
I'm completely A-O-T-P 'til the death
Esoteric zombie-killer takin' out whatever's left

You mad 'cause the army's here, top to bottom army gear
Gunshots is all you hear, death come to all who's near
We runnin' through the village killin', buildin' a regime
Heavy unstoppable, crown of thorns form, we ready

When playtime's over I'll take your mind back to the hardcore
When playtime's over I'll take your mind back to the hardcore

The God particle,
 
Armageddon weapons in my arsenal
I'm the real deal,
 
fuck an Alex Jones article
Heart is arctic cold, 
my murders are nautical
Murk you in the murky depths where the screams aren't audible
Salutations, standing over the body salivatin'
Was kicked out of hell 'cause I wouldn't bow to Satan
I'm the boss, I turn your albums off
I turn your brain to apple sauce,
 
my wingspan is like an Albatross
Out the frost, mouth spewing out exhaust out come the claws
Power force that could blow the tops of mountains off
Blow the head of cowards off, you'll get carried off
Y'all are soft as fairies buried in terrycloth

In '94 I dreamt of spreading Salt-n-Pepa's legs
But I was busy playin' dodgeball with severed heads
Conducting chaos with a chrome baton, 
so sound the smoke alarm
'Cause overall I broke your arms and kicked your ass with loafers on
Homeboy this 
HK
 settle wars
I'm a dragon, you a faggot with a tape measure sword
Celph Titled is a motherfuckin' problem
With germs that are infectious, attack like German Shepherds while acid dissolve 'em
I got the ratchet - I blast it
You got a ratchet, but you keep it in your jacket
Undercover brother on your album cover trying to look like you crazy
When your theme song should be Aerosmith, "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"

You mad 'cause the army's here, top to bottom army gear
Gunshots is all you hear, death come to all who's near
We're running through the village killing, building a regime
Heavy unstoppable, crown of thorns form, we ready

When playtime's over I'll take your mind back to the hardcore
