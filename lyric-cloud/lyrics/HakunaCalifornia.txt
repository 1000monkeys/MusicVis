You let me down
 but I let go
Couldn't stop the rain
And everyday I felt the same
But beyond the horizon
Awaits sunny days
I'm thinking about you
I'm thinking about you

I can't wait for California
I've been waiting for you
Wanna know
Wanna know
California
I've been waiting for you
Cali-fornia

I've been waiting for you
Cali-fornia

Hang it up
 in the sunset
I wanna know your name
Treble pumpin' through my veins
Waking up to a lonely day
And I don't wanna stay
'Cause I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you

I can't wait for California
I've been waiting for you
Wanna know
Wanna know
California
I've been waiting for you
Cali-fornia

I've been waiting for you
Cali-fornia

California
I've been waiting for you
Wanna know
Wanna know
California
I've been waiting for you
Cali-fornia

I've been waiting for you
Cali-fornia
