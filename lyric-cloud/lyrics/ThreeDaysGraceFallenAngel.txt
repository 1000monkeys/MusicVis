Late at night I could hear the crying
I hear it all trying to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dying

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

A fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

A fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
Just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
And I, I couldn't save a fallen angel

Fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
Just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
