I'm brighter than the sun
But I can't wait
You're asking me to stay
I can't escape
I'm staying up all night
To sleep all day
I'm brighter than the sun
But then one day
All the things that the people say
All the things that the people say
The people say
The people say
Woah
Look, they're lying
They can barely deny
We're not driving
We're just hitching a ride
How'd we get here
They can barely deny
We're not driving
We're just hitching a ride
I can't seem to find what we came here for, back around
New to me now just ain't new no more, back around
All the things that the people say
All the things that the people say
The people say
The people say
Woah
Look, they're lying
They can barely deny
We're not driving
We're just taking a ride
How'd we get here
They can barely deny
We're not driving
We're just taking a ride
I'm brighter than the sunshine
Brighter as I burn, I burn away
All the things that the people say
All the things that the people say
The people say
The people say
All the things that the people say
Have you ever had a daydream leak into your day?
Have you ever had a nightmare bigger than everybody?
Have you ever had a thought that you know won't go away?
Have you ever had a nightmare?
We're not driving
We're just taking a ride
Look, they're lying
They can barely deny
The whole world now
We can barely divide
We're not driving
We're just taking a ride
Brighter than the sunshine
Brighter as I burn, I burn away
