Who's rapping? Dovahkiin
Dragons? I'm not over keen
I'll dice 'em like a knife slicing right through an aubergine
My dragon shout flow is sweeter than a soda stream
You won't believe your eyes, I'm like an overload of dopamine
A broadsword in one hand and a magic spell in the other
I'm the last of the Dragonborn, there's no other, my brother, so run for cover
If you got scales, then I'm on your tail and I will not fail
Like a free-roaming sandbox game, I'm off the rails
I'll walk the trails through awful gales
And storms of hail 'til all the nails are knocked into your coffin
I'm not stopping 'til you're impaled and I've prevailed
In the name of the Nords, I pray to the Lords
You'll all get a taste of the blade of my sword
I'm taking on hordes of enemies
I face them with hoards of weaponry
They're draining my force
So chemistry comes into play with retorts and recipes
Alchemixing like a DJ
Restoration, restore my energy
My legacy, odyssey, elegy, prophecy's
Written in heavenly bodies
And buried with every body
That ever did bother to mess with me
Deading them terribly, horribly
I'm a celebrity, honestly
You're a wannabe, I'm a prodigy
The suggestion you're better than me at being a warrior? Ha! Comedy
It's a gift to me
I don't just spit flames lyrically but literally
And the Elder Scrolls are scripts in which I've written your obituary
I am the Dragonborn, wearing a hat with badass horns
I'm Dovahkiin, known globally, you're nobody at all
