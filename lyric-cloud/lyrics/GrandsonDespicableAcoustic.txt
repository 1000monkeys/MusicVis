The goodbye is the hardest part
When we find ourselves back at the start
But I'm not so brave, and I'm not so smart, no
I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor
One day you will understand
Why I pushed you away as I ran
And you will find a better man than I am, trust
I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor
(Ooh)

Despicable
I'm just a bottom feeder (ah)
Despicable
I ain't never been a keeper (ah)
Despicable
Love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
I wouldn't love me neither

The boy who fell into the sky
Had no one there to watch him cry
He looked at you with his empty eyes, and he said:
"I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor"
(Ooh)

Despicable
I'm just a bottom feeder (ah)
Despicable
I ain't never been a keeper (ah)
Despicable
Love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
I wouldn't love me neither

How I wish I told a different tale
Like we chased the light, and his love prevailed
But his blood ran cold, and his skin went pale
She got a letter in the mail, it said:
"I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor"
Said: "If I were you, I wouldn't love me neither"
Said: "If I were you, I wouldn't love me neither"
