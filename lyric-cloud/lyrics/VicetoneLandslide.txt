Black waves where we used to stand
Go on, give yourself a chance
Rush away like an avalanche
Look down on a lonely flame
A few steps 'til the view has changed
Broken eyes never see the same

I never saw it coming, landslide
Carry us away, away, away
In a landslide, in a landslide
I disappear into a landslide
Never be the same, the same, the same
In a landslide, in a landslide

In a landslide, in a landslide
In a landslide, in a landslide

Soaked up in a bloodshot haze
Woke up with you in my veins
I don't know how to let you fade
Look down on a lonely flame
A few steps 'til the view has changed
Broken eyes never see the same

I never saw it coming, landslide
Carry us away, away, away
In a landslide, in a landslide
I disappear into a landslide
Never be the same, the same, the same
In a landslide, in a landslide

In a landslide, in a landslide
In a landslide, in a landslide
We're falling, we're falling, we're falling all the way
We're falling, we're falling, we're falling all the way

I never saw it coming, landslide
Carry us away, away, away
In a landslide, in a landslide
I disappear into a landslide
Never be the same, the same, the same
In a landslide, in a landslide

In a landslide, in a landslide
In a landslide, in a landslide

We're falling, we're falling, we're falling all the way
(In a landslide, in a landslide)
We're falling, we're falling, we're falling all the way
(In a landslide, in a landslide)
We're falling, we're falling
(In a landslide, in a landslide)
