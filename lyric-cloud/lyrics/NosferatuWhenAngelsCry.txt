Pain begins... now!
Tonight will be different!
I am... ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger
I am the teeth in the darkness, the talons in the night
Mine is strength and lust and power!
SHOW YOURSELF!
I am forever
Why's this pain within me?
Scalding down my spine
Silently, it kills me
The endless hell is here
Save me from this nightmare
I am passing graves of the unknown
When demons rise, his rage comes through
When angels cry, he comes for you...
Tonight will be different!
Pain begins... now!
I am the teeth in the darkness, the talons in the night
Mine is strength and lust and power!
SHOW YOURSELF!
If there is hell... there is me!
Without me... there is no pain
As long as dreams continue...
Nightmares will always exist
