What doesn't kill you
Makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
One more moment, of this silence
The loneliness is killing me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
Hold up, hold up!

It comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath
And let it bury me
I'm not okay
And it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake
And bring me home again, home again?

Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I drown?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
Who will make me fight?
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown

What doesn't destroy you
Leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
One more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
Hold up, hold up

It comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath
And let it bury me
I'm not okay
And it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake
And bring me home again, home again?

Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I drown?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
Who will make me fight?
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I drown?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
