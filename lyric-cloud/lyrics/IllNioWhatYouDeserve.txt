It's too bad that you have made mistakes
Too bad that I cannot relate
When all else fails, when all else fades
I kept my way through bitter days (through bitter days)

What you don't know won't leave a scar
What you don't know hasn't killed you so far
What you don't know is who you are
I just give you something to talk about
What you don't know

It's too late I know, I've changed my mind
Too late somehow to recognize
When all else fails, and all I find
Are all my words perdido in time (just lost in time)

What you don't know won't leave a scar
What you don't know hasn't killed you so far
What you don't know is who you are
I just give you something to talk about

So you lost yourself, turn to someone else
And you can't give up your will to want to know
Then you find yourself and you're someone else
In the end you only get what you deserve (what you deserve)

What you don't know won't leave a scar
What you don't know hasn't killed you so far
What you don't know is who you are
I just give you something to talk about

What you don't know
What you don't know
What you don't know
