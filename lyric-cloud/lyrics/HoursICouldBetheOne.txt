I remember when you used to make me upset
Cried for hours sitting on my front steps
Tried to think of ways that we could make it work
We could make it work

Now I wake up in the morning, all I do is laugh
You can hit my phone up, but I ain't callin' back
We both know you're crazy, you keep tryna chase me
Ain't no point in that

'Cause I'm off the ground, higher up than I was when you were
Holdin' onto me, holdin' onto me
Yeah, you're probably listening, but let me make it clear, babe
This ain't no apology, no apologies
Yeah, baby, you're toxic, nobody can stop it
I feel bad for you
Yeah, baby, you're toxic, nobody can stop it
I feel bad for you

You said I could be the one after you changed me
Thought I wasn't good enough, but now I might be
Lookin' at you now, it's kinda funny
'Cause you still hit me up sayin' you want me, yeah

Now I wake up in the morning, all I do is laugh
You can hit my phone up, but I ain't callin' back
We both know you're crazy, you keep tryna chase me
Ain't no point in that

'Cause I'm off the ground, higher up than I was when you were
Holdin' onto me, holdin' onto me
Yeah, you're probably listening, but let me make it clear, babe
This ain't no apology, no apologies
Yeah, baby, you're toxic, nobody can stop it
I feel bad for you
Yeah, baby, you're toxic, nobody can stop it
I feel bad for you

Moving on, yeah, I'm gone
No, don't wait for me
Moving on, yeah, I'm gone
You can wave to me
Moving on, yeah, I'm gone
No, don't wait for me
You can wave to me
You can wave

Now I wake up in the morning, all I do is laugh
You can hit my phone up, but I ain't callin' back
We both know you're crazy, you keep tryna chase me
Ain't no point in that

'Cause I'm off the ground, higher up than I was when you were
Holdin' onto me, holdin' onto me
Yeah, you're probably listening, but let me make it clear, babe
This ain't no apology, no apologies
Yeah, baby, you're toxic, nobody can stop it
I feel bad for you
Yeah, baby, you're toxic, nobody can stop it
I feel bad for you

Moving on, yeah, I'm gone
No, don't wait for me
Moving on, yeah, I'm gone
You can wave to me
Moving on, yeah, I'm gone
No, don't wait for me
You can wave to me
You can wave

You're so toxic
Baby, you're so toxic
