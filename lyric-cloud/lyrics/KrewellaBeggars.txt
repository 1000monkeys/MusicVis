This one is for the fucked up, chewed up, spit out, stepped on
No luck, no fucks, tough love, half blood
Stripped down, beat down, blacked-out, choking
No sound, no crowd, burnt up, broken
We're always eager for so much more
Cause reality is a cancer and we've discovered the cure
They took your money and your freedom and your time
They almost took it all but they'll never take your mind

This one is for the beggars
Stand up if you're feeling reckless
They don't understand that we're heartless
We'll never be the same
So we take, take, take 'til we get our fucking way
Beggars
Stand up if you're feeling reckless
They don't understand that we're heartless
We'll never be the same
So we take, take, take 'til we get our fucking way

Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take
Take, take, take 'til we get our fucking way
Get our way
Get our fucking way
Beggars
Stand up if you're feeling
Get our fucking way

This one is for the sickness, dismissed, brushed off, stolen
Vicious, fearless, force-fed your slogans
Blank words, torturers, tongues-tied
So just shut the fuck up, roll up
Light you and smoke it

Beggars
Stand up if you're feeling reckless
They don't understand that we're heartless
We'll never be the same
So we take, take, take 'til we get our fucking way
Beggars
Stand up if you're feeling reckless
They don't understand that we're heartless
We'll never be the same
So we take, take, take 'til we get our fucking way

Get our way
Get our fucking way
Beggars
Stand up if you're feeling
Get our fucking way

Beggars
This one is for the beggars
Stand up if you're feeling reckless
They don't understand that we're heartless
We'll never be the same
So we take, take, take, 'til we get our fucking way
