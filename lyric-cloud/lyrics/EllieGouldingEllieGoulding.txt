You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Everyday I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away
Noooo....
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me
Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain
Noooo....
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me
