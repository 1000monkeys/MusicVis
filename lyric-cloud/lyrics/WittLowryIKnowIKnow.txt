Look, I ain't gon' lie, was tryin' to find feelin's
'Cause lately I have been feelin' numb
It's not fair to you, you deserve the one
Stop tellin' me I'm the perfect one
'Cause perfect is perception
Perception is all that they can see
Saw people turned fake like make-believe
Never gonna find fake in me
Know I don't ever give a fuck if they hate you
They probably hate themselves too
A couple girls want to date you
Couple years ago I was see-through
You would never make it from the same shoes
Never gave me credit when I payed dues
Need a couple beats I put the pain to
A couple years ago, I was mean too
That's back when I could barely pay rent
Savin' water bottles just to make cents
Spill my soul each and every night
On a couple beats that Dan Haynes sent
Was waitin' tables and a waitress told me
That my stupid dreams never made sense
Had a 9 to 5, couple people hatin'
And they still sittin' at the same desk

I know, I know I got this shit
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem, that's how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
I know, I know, I got the juice
I keep it true forever, I know, I know

I came from nothin', but I'm feelin' like the man right now
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
The-they don't like me, I don't fit into their plans right now, yeah
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
I stand for somethin' and that's why I'm where I stand right now
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
Thought I would quit, but shit, this world is in my hands right now
Yeah, I know, I know

I know, I know, I deserve better
We were held together by four letters
Took a couple L's, ended up in hell
Thought the love was real, shoulda known better
Had to bounce back
Invest all the money my account had
While rappers rap about a round ass, I'ma fuck the game
And take the crown back, that's a sound fact
Here's a soundtrack for everyone who doubted
And even me, I even thought about it
Your fake love, I could do without it
Every fuckin' stage, I leave the people shoutin'
And I'm the people's champ, I'm the new Rock
This is new rap, this is new pop
This is new rock, I fit no genre
The one and only, the new Mantra
Fuck commas, no, I'm never stoppin'
Still underrated, started from the bottom
Only see me fall if it was fuckin' autumn
Got a lotta followers, too bad you bought 'em
I'm a fuckin' problem, I just say it twice
I'm a fuckin' problem through the pain I write
Talk to myself when I need great advice
Stars shine the brightest in the darkest nights, now

I know, I know I got this shit
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem, that's how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
I know, I know, I got the juice
I keep it true forever, I know, I know

I came from nothin', but I'm feelin' like the man right now
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
The-they don't like me, I don't fit into their plans right now, yeah
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
I stand for somethin' and that's why I'm where I stand right now
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
Thought I would quit, but shit, this world is in my hands right now
Yeah, I know, I know

Yeah, you didn't fuck with me then
How you gon' fuck with me now?
Funny how everything changed
Now they in love with the sound
Don't give a fuck what they say
You should come see me on tour
Had to cut ties from the fake
You cannot play me no more
Maybe I should get high
Need somethin' to balance the lows
Somethin' to deal with the pain
Someone to call on my phone
I'm in love with the truth
Did this all on our own
Only real will remain
Maybe that's all I know

I know, I know I got this shit
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem, that's how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
I know, I know, I got the juice
I keep it true forever, I know, I know

I came from nothin', but I'm feelin' like the man right now
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
The-they don't like me, I don't fit into their plans right now, yeah
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
I stand for somethin' and that's why I'm where I stand right now
I know, I know now, I know, I know now
Thought I would quit, but shit, this world is in my hands right now
Yeah, I know, I know
