Cast the fire!
I live inside the burning flame
Presenting what you know as pain and it hurts
To see thy loved one disappear
Return to dust and to silence!
I welcome you stranger for what you were
I’m passing you over onto this world
We’re high on the mountain, let go and see
The ember’s glow will set you free
Fly with the sirens
And free the soul
It’s The Everlasting leaving home
Your memory will live forever more
Cast the fire!
I live inside the burning flame
Presenting what you know as pain and it hurts
To see thy loved ones disappear
Return to dust and to silence!
I’m passing you over onto this world
I welcome you stranger, for what you are
Up high on the mountain, the goal is set
The ember’s glow will set you free
Fly with the sirens and free the soul
The Everlasting leaving home
Your memory will live forevermore
You wear your scars with pride and joy
What doesn't kill you will make you strong
Sadness wins and sadness lose
You find the balance and make it yours
And life goes on, and on, and on
On and on and on
You saw the light when you were born
I step back while I truly care where you go
So you cast the fire!
I live inside the burning flame
Presenting what you know as pain and it hurts
To see thy loved one disappear
Return to dust and to silence
We’re high on the mountain
Let go once there
The embers glow
It’s The Everlasting
Fly with the sirens
Let go of me
The embers glow
It’s The Everlasting
It’s The Everlasting
