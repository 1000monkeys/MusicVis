I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm flyin' high on paper planes, but they don't hold up
Make mistakes, but I'll be damned if I don't own them
It's a trip and I don't wanna get sober, don't wanna get sober
Livin' fast in a daydream
They can try, but I'll be dead before they change me
'Cause my guitar's the only one that ever paid me
It's a trip and I'll be lovin' every single minute
Long as I can say I did it

My way, my way
My way, my way
Just go and get it (My way)
I'll know I did it (My way)
I'll say I did it
My way, my way
My way, my way
I won't regret it, no way
I'll know I did it
My way, my way

I can say I did it
I can say I did it
Can say I did
As long as I can say I did, say I did

Ain't saying I never get hopeless
And things get crazy when it all gets out of focus
On the days when we're together, that's a bonus
My darling, we're just living for the moment, living for the moment
Will you love me 'til you leave, yeah?
Yeah, I never wanna stop you going somewhere
Go 'head and live the way you wanna, I will always love ya
You know that your heart is in it
Long as you can say I did it

My way, my way
My way, my way
Just go and get it (My way)
I'll know I did it (My way)
I say I did it
My way, my way
My way, my way
I won't regret it, no way
I'll know I did it
My way, my way

I can say I did it
I can say I did it
Can say I did
As long as I can say I did, say I did

We only get one life, so make this life beautiful
One chance to make it worthwhile
Just be alive, the story could be glorious
Beginning to the finish, long as I can say I did it
My way, my way
My way, my way

Just go and get it (My way)
I'll know I did it (My way)
I say I did it
My way, my way
My way, my way
I won't regret it, no way
I'll know I did it
My way, my way

I can say I did it
I can say I did it
 (My way)
Can say I did
As long as I can say I did, say I did, say I did
My way, my way, my way, my way
My way, my way, my way, my way
My way, my way, my way, my way
As long as I can say I did
My way, my way

My way, my way
My way, my way
Just go and get it
I'll know I did it my way
I say I did it
My way, my way
My way, my way
I won't regret it, no way
I'll know I did it
My way, my way
