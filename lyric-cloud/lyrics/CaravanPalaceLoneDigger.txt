Hey, brother, what you thinking?
Leave that old record spinning
You feel the rhythm going
(
They call it lonely diggin'
)
Let's end your time to lay low
Your knees are bending and so
It's time to get up and let go
(
You're gonna come undone
)
Hey, mama, how's it going?
Can't see your body moving
Don't leave the party dying
(
They call it lonely diggin'
)

Your booty shaking, you know
Your head has no right to say no
Tonight it's "Ready, set, go!"

Baby, can you move it round the rhythm?
So we can get with 'em
To the crowd, and get us a rock and roll 'round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby, can you move it round the rhythm?
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams
When I come up on the scene

Hey, brother, what you thinking?
That good ol' sound is ringing
They don't know what they're missing
(
They call it lonely diggin'
)
Let's end your time to lay low
Your knees are bending and so
It's time to get up and let go
Hey, brother, nice and steady
Put down your drink, you're ready
It's hard when things get messy
(
They call it lonely diggin'
)

Your booty shaking, you know
Your head has no right to say no
Tonight it's "Ready, set, go!"

Baby, can you move it round the rhythm?
So we can get with 'em
To the crowd, and get us a rock and roll 'round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby, can you move it round the rhythm?
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams
When I come up on the scene
