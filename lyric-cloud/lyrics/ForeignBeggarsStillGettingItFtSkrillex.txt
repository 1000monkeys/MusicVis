Still getting it 

Yeah, out here and still getting it
More food, more love, still getting it
Beggar-fam, repping like they're still getting it, getting it
Something like the best, still getting it
Yeah, out here and still getting it
Ten years deep in the game, still getting it
Beggar-fam, repping like they're still getting it, getting it
Something like the best, still getting it
Going ahead full speed in the lane still getting it
Still getting it 

Going ahead at full speed in the lane still getting it
 

Yo, I got parred 
O-V got bars above any guy
Many guys step but coming up with any tripe
Many try rep but they sweating when the Beggars hype (hype)
I'm not very nice when I rhyme
When I bless mics, when I rep it in the dead of night
(Bredren) We can stay vexed but we blessed
Cah everything nice, mandem headed for a better life
 

And you know we're still reppin' it
Ten years on the stage, still wreckin' it
We're going on something like Lock, Stock
Well you man are shooting in black socks still petting it
Best you raise up your game
Coming like snipers arranged taking aim
Beggars might try but they can't keep pace
Going ahead full speed in the lane still getting it
Still getting it 

Get down low, I'm here and I starting
Get down low, I'm here and I starting
 
Still getting it 
Yeah
Foreign Beggars, Skrillex
Out here mate
Going deep on this one
Going ahead full speed in the lane still getting it
