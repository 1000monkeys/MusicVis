For you, for you

How did you tell it's okay?
When I need a high from the story?
And you are the one that I crave
Every night, you know, I'm searching for you

I'm searching for you
I'm searching for you
For you
I'm searching for you
Searching for you
For you

For you, for you

Oh, baby, baby
Feeling around in the dark
Am I getting close to a spark?
I'm tired of your hate in my heart
I just need ya now, I'm searching for you

I'm searching for you, you
I'm searching for you, you

For you
I'm searching for you, you
For you
I'm searching for you
