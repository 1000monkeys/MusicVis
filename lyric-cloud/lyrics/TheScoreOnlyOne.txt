Tell me can you see me now?
While you were busy lost in the crowd
I was busy making myself
Into someone free from doubt
I was down and left on the shelf
I wanted a story to tell

I scream it to the people
Started calling
Singing words that came from all the fallen
Down, down
Now, now

It's time to breakout
So everybody just scream out
I'm the only one (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't make me break down
And I can finally see now
I'm the only one (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't hold me down

Tell me how it feels to know
I'm not a puppet under control
I cut the strings a long time ago, oh
I guess that I should thank you though
Cause all you was the fire for my soul
And now I'm up here running the show

I scream it to the people
Started calling
Singing words that came from all the fallen
Down, down
Now, now

It's time to breakout
So everybody just scream out
I'm the only one (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't make me break down
And I can finally see now
I'm the only one (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't hold me down

No chains, no chains won't hold me...

And when the dust is settled down
You'll be all alone thinking, "how?"
Everyone is singing aloud

It's time to breakout
So everybody just scream out
I'm the only one (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one
No truth, no chains won't make me break down
And I can finally see now
I'm the only one (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't hold me down
