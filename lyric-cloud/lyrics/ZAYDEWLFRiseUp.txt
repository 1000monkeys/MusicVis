You tried to tell us it was all gonna end
We hear the noise and start to plan our revenge
And we’re hard to stop
We’re hard to stop (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Hiding from trouble and you went the wrong way
You might keep running, but you’ll never escape
'Cause we’re hard to stop
We’re hard to stop (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
This is where it begins
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Made to be legends

If there’s a shadow hanging over our fate
We won’t forget that deep inside we’re the same
And we’re hard to stop
We’re hard to stop (oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh)

Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Yeah, this is where it begins
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Made to be legends

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
This is where it begins
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Oh, made to be legends

Rise up
Rise up

Ain't no stopping us now (Oh-oh-oh)
Ain't no stopping us now (Oh-oh-oh)
Ain't no stopping us now (Oh-oh-oh)
Ain't no stopping us, no stopping us (we were legends)
Ain't no stopping us now (rise up)
Ain't no stopping us now (rise up)
Ain't no stopping us now (rise up)
This is where it begins (we were legends)
Ain't no stopping us now
Ain't no stopping us now (this is where it begins)
Ain't no stopping us now
Made to be legends
Made to be legends
