Black and white
Dancing together
Side by side we'll make things better
You're never alone
Dancing together
Side by side though stormy weather
You're never alone 
Never alone
You're never alone
Never alone 
You're never alone
Black and white
Dancing together
Side by side we'll make things better
You're never alone
Dancing together
Side by side though stormy weather
You're never alone
Never alone 
You're never alone
Never alone 
You're never alone
Never alone
You're never alone
Black and white
Dancing together
Side by side we'll make things better
You're never alone
Dancing together
Side by side though stormy weather
You're never alone
Never alone 
You're never alone
