I'm beginning to feel like a rap god
No fuck that I'm beginning to feel like everybody rapping is a whack, dog
Sound like they smoke too much crack and pot and I'm a crack pot on bath salts
If you wanna face off, I'll eat your fucking face off, face it your soft
And I'm hard as metal
Watch artists tremble
I'm sharp as the sharpest sharpened pencil
Raise the bar to stars and mars and vessels
You're starting to bark, your bite hardly settled
Tryna tell everybody you are the devil?
You're dark as yellow, you're hard as jello
You smart as a mental retard in a special kindergarten class
Who keeps barking?
"Hello! How are you?!"
Sit the fuck down and listen the fuck up, as a push hard on the pedal
I'm respecting every legend but I'm tryna be better than everyone
Wrecking Eminem on his own track
Severing the heads of everybody who's stepping bet I be getting a pen and pin 'em down when I get a note pad
"Oh snap!"
And I am not saying that I'm rapping better because I flow fast
I'm saying that I'm rapping better cuz I'm rapping better and you should know that
Who told your old ass to tell your whole pack that they spitting this shit raw
"Huh?"
Mother fucker I will have you cleaning shit out of your drawers 
while you picking up your jaw
I'm jaw dropping like hot pockets
 I stick you in a box
Called coffins when my songs dropping like what 
menopause causing I'm mood swinging on you all
Speaking of menopause, you never will be fit to reproduce this
So I'm telling you men-to-pause, or death is your peace like Grim Reeper's-deuces
Jeez Louise yo who's this?
He's fifteen a freaking student?
He don't even need improvement
Team's the Lethal People movement
Killing with the words
Fuck everybody else like a popular drug dealer I'm flipping every bird
If Em's the rap god I'm the minister
When I do it bet I too am representing everything he's doing
You developing a deficit you definitely never get the penmanship element present in my music
I ain't a human, I'm a mutant, from the moon this, means I'm never down to earth
So I can't sound out a verse
Without me first bragging 'bout all my work
Man I sound like a jerk, you don't wanna hear me bragging 'bout talent you wanna hear me bragging 'bout money like everyone now does word?
How 'bout first, I talk about the cars narcotics and guns
Then talk about how struggling a town is in the next line and still give em a dollar for funds
But I'ma drop so hot you thought it was pot out the oven and you've forgotten your gloves
Fuck the industry initially I gotta make a song to a relevant beat just to see you listen to me
I'm physically turning into beast but ain't no beauty in it
I got acne and some fat cheeks but truth or fiction?
I'm the "young rap god" and if so peep the new religion
Praying to Pac and then I study Eminem
And story telling from Nas
And growing the flow of Rakim
Giving me ridiculous ability of spitting and delivery so nobody can do it symmetry
I don't see any mini-me's but it's not because they don't wanna copy because they don't have the ability to spit like me
You are literally never getting me you getting close to me you getting closer to a cemetery
If your aim is bumping into me your brain must struggle mentally
When I say I don't like you that ain't a fucking simile
It's Token and you ain't gon see an equal who gon killed this beat
(Rap god)
