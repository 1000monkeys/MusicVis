You got the potion yeah you really do
Make everybody fall in love with you
Call me your lover call me another
All I hear are lies from you
They're throwing stones and you’re feeling bad
Blue baby friends are all you ever had
Lie to you I won’t
Lie to me you may
But now is not the time and death is not the place but

Would you come with me
I want you to come with me
Cuz I can’t do this alone
Oh and society is putting scars on my body
It’s got me acting so naughty
Setting fire to my home
I’m just another skeleton in her closet
A freak like no one knows
Buried bones up in her backyard with dirt between my toes
Yeah I used to really love her
But now I just don't know
The time between us faded all the love I felt below
And I wish I may I wish I might have some love today
You know I could
You know I would find a way to stay
But now is not the time and here is not the place
I’m on my way to somewhere these scars I can't erase

So would you come with me
Oh I want you to come with me
Cuz I can’t do this alone, no

Ohh and society is putting scars on my body
It’s got me acting so naughty
Setting fire to my home
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Would you come with me
Oh I want you to come with me
Cuz I can’t do this alone
Oh and society is putting scars on my body
It’s got me acting so naughty
Setting fire to my home
Oh no no yeah
Oh no no
It’s putting scars on my body
Setting fire to my home
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh and it makes no difference
It makes no difference to me
I’m feeling so god damn good
Oh yeah
It makes no difference
It makes no difference to me
Yeah yeah yeah
