Yeah

Another night, I can barely sleep
I pray to God my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to God my soul to take
I pray to God, I'll be over-great
Not another wack rapper that they overrate
Y'all spoiled like the South in the Florida state
I'm always overworked and never overpaid
But I prayed for it, yeah
And when they told me that I couldn't, man, I had to find a way for it, yeah
Serve a table everyday, had to find a way to pay for it, damn
And when I started goin' numb is when I realized I was made for it, yeah
So it's, "Fuck all my feelings," I feel like the villain, feel like I overstepped boundaries
Feel like you're better without me
Feel like I'm drownin', feel like I never had found me
I don't want no one around me
I don't think nobody knows how it feels
When there's so many people, yet no one to listen
I try to do good with the talent I'm given
I try to see clear, yet attention's been blockin' my vision
Surrounded by fake
And honestly, lately debate how much more I can take
A couple more shots to the face
I often don't drink, so I'm searchin' for somethin' to chase
She's puttin' my hands on her waist
Her tongue's in my mouth and I wonder what pain she can taste
I'm takin' caffeine when I wake
And tired of takin' the pill with PM just to sleep when it's late, I don't

I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm pickin' up the pieces
Of that person I once knew
I've been losin' you, you
You, you
You, you
I've been losin' you

I guess I've lost me for a while, well
Welcome back
Lately I forgot how a smile felt, now
Picture that
Thought that I could buy happy, maybe buy a new car in all black
Put the whole entire team on the map
Everything I have now, had to work for all that
But, to see my dad again, I would give it all back
They just want me to rap, I feel like a slave to this shit
I know that I prayed for this shit
But if I have one more fake convo with one more fake person
I might just go ape in this shit
Rememberin' back, we had no place to live, and
You spent my rent money on clothes that you're wearin'
Confusin' your Instagram followers for people who care
And you'll never find happy when stuck in comparin'
I know, I miss the feelin' of feelin' feelings
Now every song I write I been drippin' and oozin' real, and
I try to tell my story, yeah, feelin' is less appealin'
'Em rappers that like to mumble and already hit the ceilin', so fuck
Didn't fuck with me way back then, now it's "Hey, what's up?"
Yeah, is it weird that I still feel stuck?
Think it's funny when I spill my guts 'cause I feel?
Feelin' like I need to stop playin', he's real
I spent last week in bed and the weekend was drunk
'Cause I honestly just couldn't deal
It's been seven days now without you, that makes one weak
You turn into someone else after just one drink
Wonder if I'm on your mind when you think
And, honestly, I tried to help you find youâ€”and instead lost me, now I don't

I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm pickin' up the pieces
Of that person I once knew
I've been losin' you, you
You, you
You, you
I've been losin' you
