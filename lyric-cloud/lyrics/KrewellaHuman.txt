Is anybody there?
Does anybody care what I'm feeling?
I wanna disappear
So nobody can hear me when I'm screaming
Cause I could use a hand sometimes
Yeah, I could use a hand sometimes

They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise and you are just confused
But I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
I am only human
I am only human

The night is bitter cold
I wonder if you know that I'm sleepless
Waiting like a ghost
When I need you the most, I go unnoticed
Cause I could use a hand sometimes
Yeah, I could use a hand sometimes

They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise and you are just confused
But I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
I am only human

The weight of the world is pulling me down
(Where are you now?)
Every breath feels like I'm gonna drown
(Where are you now?)
I'm the only one left alone on this Earth?
(This earth)
Singing this song but can't find the words

Cause I could use a hand sometimes
Yeah, I could use a hand sometimes

They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise and you are just confused
But I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
