Life in the fast lane
High off of insane
You're my cocaine lover
Got guilt in your pocket
Forget about it
I just blew your cover

Blow, blow, blow, blow
I just blew your cover
Blow, blow, blow, blow

I wanna be your habit
Calm you down like Xanax
'Cause if you're nervous you shouldn't be
I'll take away your panic
Just leave your heart wide open
My love comes in doses
So if you're nervous you shouldn't be
I'll take away your panic
I wanna be your

Calm you down like
I wanna be your

Some things always last
Vintage photograph
You look like your father
Run until you're crazy
Ya suffocating baby
Just like your mother

Blow, blow, blow, blow
I just blew your cover
Blow, blow, blow, blow

I wanna be your habit
Calm you down like Xanax
'Cause if you're nervous you shouldn't be
I'll take away your panic
Just leave your heart wide open
My love comes in doses
So if you're nervous you shouldn't be
I'll take away your panic
Calm you down like

Calm you down like
I wanna be your

I wanna be right here right next to you
Your prescription's overdue
I wanna be right here right next to you
Your prescription's overdue
I wanna be right here right next to you
Your prescription's overdue
I wanna be right here right next to you
I wanna be your
