The sun ablaze as Maria's foot touches the sand
On northern land, as human contraband
She got her name passed down to the Boss
Now she’s stuck on a truckbed, clutching her cross
Yanqui guns, blood debts on the loans
Smoldering fields with rape, rubble, and bones
Graves hidden, trapped in visions of war
She prays to nothing, no one, nobody no more

Tear away at the mask
Oh, tear away at the mask

And now she's got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approaches, his steps pound in her brain
His steps pound in her brain
Her arms jerks, the sisters gather ’round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody no more

Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Ooh, tear away at the mask

No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
It eclipses her day
Just a moment to pray
Just a moment to pray
No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
It eclipses her day
Just a moment to pray
Just a moment to pray

Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
