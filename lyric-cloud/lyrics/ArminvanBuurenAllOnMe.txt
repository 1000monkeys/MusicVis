You, don't you dare let you
I'm right here, you know, I mean that
Don't even think the thought
If it's real or not, I've seen it

When your heart's been open to someone who's broken
Let me take some weight off of ya
When you're tired of livin' like you're not forgiven
Let me share that burden with ya
Woah

You think you're losing everything and you're down too deep
Put it all on me (All on me)
I'll do anything to set you free, I'll pay your fee
Oh, put it all on me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah
All on me
All on me
Woah
All on me
All on me

Filled, wear them on your sleeve
So they all can see you did it
Dreams, yeah, they made you bleed
But you never stopped believing

When your heart's been open to someone who's broken
Let me take some weight off of ya
When you're tired of livin' like you're not forgiven
Let me share that burden with ya
Woah

You think you're losing everything and you're down too deep
Put it all on me (All on me)
I'll do anything to set you free, I'll pay your fee
Oh, put it all on me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah
All on me
All on me
Woah
All on me
All on me

Woah
All on me
All on me
Woah
All on me
All on me
