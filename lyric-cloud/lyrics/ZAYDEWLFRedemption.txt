Oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh...

Standing on the edge of a mountain
Watching the world turn black
We could fade away
But we don't have to go with the outcome
Something is calling me back
To die another day

Oh...
We don’t have to let go, no
Oh...
We don't have to let go, no
Oh...
We won't ever quit, oh no
Let the games begin!
Let the games begin!

This is the day of redemption!
Oh, oh, oh...
The day of redemption!
Oh, oh, oh...
Yeah, I can see the fear coming
But you’re never catching me running
The moment, it's coming for someone
This is the day of redemption!

You can take the red or the blue pill
But you're gonna have to choose
You can't walk away
We can slip down where the truth lies
The future is calling you
To die another day

Oh...
We don't have to let go, no
Oh...
We don't have to let go, no
Oh...
We won't ever quit, oh no
Let the games begin!
Let the games begin!

This is the day of redemption!
Oh, oh, oh... (redemption, redemption)
The day of redemption!
Oh, oh, oh... (Yes it is!)
Yeah, I can see the fear coming
But you're never catching me running
The moment, it’s coming for someone
This is the day of redemption!

This is the day of redemption!
Oh, oh, oh...
The day of redemption!
Oh, oh, oh...
Yeah, I can see the fear coming
But you’re never catching me running
The moment, it's coming for someone
This is the day of redemption!
