Everybody left and right
Break it down...
Back in '79 I did the John Belushi
In 1992 I did the Chris Farley
In 2008 I did the Cloverfield monster
I said fuck that shit and went back to the Belushi
It's like cats, cats, cats cats cats
Back in the day it's like cats cats cats
I know what it takes to make things worse
And I know what it takes to put a nigga in a hearse
I'm on CRACK
Break it down
Break, break, break
Break it down
Break, break, break
I'm on CRACK
Break it down
Break, break it, break it
Yo break it down
Look to the right, look to the left
Look to the right, to the left
This little piggy is in the market
For some motherfuckers who wanna start shit
Asian people love golf (What?)
Asian people love golf!
Cats, cats, cats cats cats
Back in the day it's like cats cats cats
I know what it takes to make things worse
And I know what it takes to put a nigga in a hearse
I'm on CRACK
Break it down
Break, break, break
Break it down
Break, break, break
I'm on CRACK
Break it down
Break, break it, break it
Yo break it down
Who's bust -- who's who's bustin' out those rhymes?
