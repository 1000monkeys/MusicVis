I wanna take the train with you
I wanna run away with you
Come on run away, run away with me

I got a secret window
From there you can see it all
Don't be afraid to reach it
Don't be afraid to fall
Respect the fact that everything you hate
Your thoughts, your words and everything you say
Defines you, defined you
(Ooh, oh, oh)

I wanna take the train with you
I wanna run away with you
Come on run away, run away with me
Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
I wanna run away with you
I wanna run away
I wanna take the train with you
I wanna take the train
Would you have my hand when I'm dying?
Sick of growing old

Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
All night, into the day
Yeah, I'm always running

I smile in the face of failure
I smile in the face of fear
Cause I got a secret window
And I'm gonna take you there
Accept the fact that everything you hate
Your thoughts, your words and every single day
Defines you, defined you
(Ooh, oh, oh)

I wanna take the train with you
I wanna run away with you
Come on run away, run away with me
Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
I wanna run away with you
I wanna run away
I wanna take the train with you
I wanna take the train
Would you have my hand when I'm dying?
Sick of growing old

Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
All night, into the day
Yeah, I'm always running

All night
All night, all night
Pushing through the day
Wasted my life, my life
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you

I wanna take the train with you
I wanna run away with you
Come on run away, run away with me
Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
I wanna run away with you
I wanna run away
I wanna take the train with you
I wanna take the train
Would you have my hand when I'm dying?
Sick of growing old

Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
All night, into the day
Yeah, I'm always running
Run, run, push it away
Yeah, I'm always running
All night, into the day
Yeah, I'm always running
