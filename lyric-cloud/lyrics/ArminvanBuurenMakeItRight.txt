I still see us by the ocean, drinking in that summer high
Fading in the sunshine, boy, we were killing time
You were like my best friend
You were like the reason I felt alive
Hear you say forever, think I might be losing my mind

I keep fallin' back to when we were together
Only you can make this right
Tell me lies pretend you'll never leavin'
Even if I'm dreaming tonight
I just wanna go back to the days
When your heart and mine beat at the same pace
Take me back to when we were together
Only you can make it

Make it right right, make it right
Make it right right, make it right
Make me right right, make me right
Make me right right, make me right

Only you can make it
Make me right right, make me right
Only make me right right, make me right

I keep fallin' back to when we were together
Only you can make this right
Tell me lies, pretend you'll never leavin'
Even if I'm dreaming tonight
I just wanna go back to the days
When your heart and mine beat at the same pace
Take me back to when we were together
Only you can make it

Make it right right, make it right
Make it right right, make it right
Make me right right, make me right
Make me right right, make me right
Make me right
Only you can make me right
