Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Collective on the scene bringing change to the game
It's a shame we just trying to maintain in this game
When the Capitol Hill's Insane In The Membrane
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Collective on the scene bringing change to the game
Simple and plane just trying to maintain in this game
When the Capitol Hill's Insane In The Membrane
Swinging on the scene with the ill Drеam Team
I mean my crew's clеan and my spit games mean
Bars hit like Luke Cage as soon as we hit the stage
Leave the crowd in the rage when the Beats gets slayed
Bum rush the set a quiet as it's kept
Keep My Mind Funk flexed like the monks in Tibet
Man I'm focused I got no time for you Jokers free your mind bend the time Dr Strange Hocus Pocus
Cloak and Dagger with a fortified Swagger Fortress of fortitude with a black lives matter
All lives matter but the matter of fact is all don't have the privilege of living while Blackish
Wakanda forever and ever whatever's clever
Bucky through his arm in that fight and got it severed
Call cap America to protect us with the shield
But Hydra's infiltrated the shield the foe's real
Avengers assemble for civil war to infinity
Incivility against a complex divinity complex
Xavier mind check who's next grab you
Stones snap your fingers and change the context
It’s the lyrical wizard here to cast a spell again
Long black locs and skin full of melanin
Here to get it pumping like a shot of adrenaline
With the power of grey skull packed with intelligence
First leaders and teachers were great black minds
We come with the knowledge from ancient times
Flows cold, we slide up on ya like Frozone
If you not with the movement BREAK like Turbo and Ozone
Collective bringing unity, rally around us
From an alternate universe like Miles Morales
There’s no S.H.I.E.L.D. from being hung by the jury they pick
That’s why they fear us cause our lyrics bring the Fury like Nick
Our movements and leaders investigated by bureaus
When in reality our ancestors were all  kings and Pharaohs
Somewhere along the line we were downgraded to ZERO
Here to save you all, Black Superheroes
Never a solution they just offer assistance
Policies and legislature kept at a distance
Most important part, listen up... don’t miss this
Respect our existence or expect our resistance. Pow!
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Collective on the scene bringing change to the game
It's a shame we just trying to maintain in this game
When the Capitol Hill's Insane In The Membrane
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Collective on the scene bringing change to the game
Simple and plane just trying to maintain in this game
When the Capitol Hill's Insane In The Membrane
Ring the alarm it's time to sound the bell
Listen up, I'm here to save you all from yourselves
All black leather trench coat I been dope
All black El Dorado all powerful
Sliding thru your town we fighting for what's right
With fists in the air the new improved Dark Knight
Coming with the strength of Hancock we can't stop
Imposing our will on the damn cops
Avenging my brother's death, we're playing chess
While they play checkers next move is the best
My superpower is a photographic memory
So I recall vividly what the enemy did to me
Mind over matter, we strapped with the literature
Prisoners of war, time to overtake the visitors
Break the monotony, get the people out there comfort zones
Channel that energy, vibranium undertones
Brain power is enough to move the Earth's axis
Forward progress, moving to the east Blackwards
Black powers ACTIVATE
Collective, we leading the charge, freedom or death so emancipate
Black Lightning striking
Thunder and Lightning
Hear us march when we stomp the ground we still fighting
Senses are heightened
The Movement’s tightened
Justice may be young but the future has brightened
Pop my claws for the cause
Freedom delayed? Pause
Like the New Mutants I give a damn about your laws
My mutant liberation brings Stryfe
Tryin to cut my Cable but I know you ain’t about that life
Secret Wars bring Secret Invasions
Inviting super Skrulls to the barbecue? infiltration
Over 400 years of strategic Decimation
But a self consuming fire brings light to the nation
Destroyer of worlds or bringer of life
Resurrected like Jean Grey, Superman or Christ
From the ash, burning embers spark a new fight
My people like the Phoenix about to take flight
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Collective on the scene bringing change to the game
It's a shame we just trying to maintain in this game
When the Capitol Hill's Insane In The Membrane
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Collective on the scene bringing change to the game
Simple and plane just trying to maintain in this game
When the Capitol Hill's Insane In The Membrane
Secret ID of a Martian cop
It’s the Vox, juggernaut too hard to stop
Rebel MC up against the Orthodox
Until I run it like the captain of the Argo not
Jason but Avatar blazing in my Battlestar
Impact of the verse shaken and rattle y’all
Blackhawk from Thenegar with an Nth metal mic
Spaceship rhymin up against your pedal bikes
Trying to make sure my people have a better life
Showing them all satisfaction instead of strife
This time around the revolutions getting televised
Anybody not involved is getting terrified
It’s a deep dive strap up we going in
Bring the word like holy men at the podium
The one that’s composing the symposium
Here to save the day the last black Kryptonian
And if the people who are called by my name
Would call out their name
As if it were their names the were crying out as a remembrance
To what have happen to the slain once again to the slain in vain
Would find the strength to fight against the racial injustice
And warfare that has gone far too long in our community
And find humility for the ancestors who sought and pray that one day
Change was indeed going to come
From the wicked way that white supremacy has taken over our babies
Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers from their dreams
Only to continue to have this repetitive dream
That change indeed must come by any means necessary
Find solidarity, be legendary to the change that must come, that will come
For change is the only thing that is constant and true if we are to really matter
Regardless of our hue
