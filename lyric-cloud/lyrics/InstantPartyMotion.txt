Do what you want in this world

I got my hand on the bible

Can't no one fuck up my high
Pour me Another  let's get it, let's get it
Who ever said that a limit's the limit
Nigga's i'm wit know the vision - We in it

And ain't a thing come between us
Look i go back to back to back

Tried to show these "quote unquotes" devotion
They ain't notice it

Pray we never get exhausted
Pray the money keep Callin'
