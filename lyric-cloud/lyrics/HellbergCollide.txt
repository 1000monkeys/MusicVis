(Missile directed to the heart)
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart, yeah

You draw me near
And I can't slow down, no
Can you feel it too?
There ain't no stopping now
Feet off the ground, head to the sky
Yeah, wind by my side
You're in my vision, directly we collide

You pull me in, I don't resist
The time seems to fly, but the clock doesn't tick
I crash into you, we both feel the hit
We both feel the way that our chemicals mix
And I wish that
I, just keep my eyes shut
Maybe this time it'll be enough
Ooh

You own the night
So I need the dark
Without you here, I wouldn't ever see the stars
I'm headed for you
Foot on the gas
I'm coming straight at you, no looking back
Ooh woooaaah
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart, yeah
Then we collide


I'm here
I'm your statue
Your heart is a magnet, I'm coming at you
Girl, you're my target I'm aiming at you
You're a comet, I'm trying to catch you
You can break any rule they ever taught you
Forget about anything they ever bought you
'Cause me and you, don't need a lot in this world to get by
Plus, you know I've got you

You pull me in, I don't resist
The time seems to fly, but the clock doesn't tick
I crash into you, we both feel the hit
We both feel the way that our chemicals mix
And I wish that
I, just keep my eyes shut
Maybe, this time it'll be enough
Ooh

You own the night
So I need the dark
Without you here, I wouldn't ever see the stars
I'm headed for you
Foot on the gas
I'm coming straight at you, no looking back
Ooh wooooaaah
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart, yeah
Then we collide


Ooh woooaaah
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart, yeah
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart
Then we collide
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed to the heart, yeah
You are my star
We are connected, missile directed, missile directed
Then we collide
