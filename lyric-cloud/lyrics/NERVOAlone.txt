Don't you walk away from me now
You hold my heart, you hold me down
And I try and try to fight it
But the darkness always hides it

I don't wanna be alone tonight
(I don't wanna be, oh, I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna feel alone
(I don't wanna feel, oh, I don't wanna feel)
'Cause baby, I ain't feeling strong tonight
(I ain't feeling strong, oh, I ain't feeling strong)
And I don't wanna be alone, alone tonight
Alone tonight
Alone tonight

I won't walk away from you now
So hold me close, don't let me down
'Cause I tried and tried to fight it
But right now, I can't deny this

I don't wanna be alone tonight
(I don't wanna be, oh, I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna feel alone
(I don't wanna feel, oh, I don't wanna feel)
'Cause baby, I ain't feeling strong tonight
(I ain't feeling strong, oh, I ain't feeling strong)
And I don't wanna be alone, alone tonight
Alone tonight
Tonight, tonight

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna feel alone
