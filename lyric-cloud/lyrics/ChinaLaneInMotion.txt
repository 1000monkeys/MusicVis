You call yourself a fighter
You don't know what you'd be
I am a survivor
There ain't nothing between
Anytime you call in a hurry
I don't have the time to be there
Anytime you call in a hurry
I don't have the time to be there
Alive when you hear me
Feeling in motion
Alive when you hear me
Feeling in motion
You ain't nothing baby
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh, oh, HEY!)
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh, oh, OH!)
Baby, I'm on fire
What you doing to me
Can only take me higher
There ain't nothing between
Anytime you call in a hurry
I don't have the time to be there
Anytime you call in a hurry
I don't have the time to be there
Alive when you hear me
Feeling in motion
Alive when you hear me
Feeling in motion
You ain't nothing baby
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh, oh, HEY!)
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh) Without my love
(Oh, oh, oh, OH!)
Alive when you hear me
Feeling in motion
Alive when you hear me
Feeling in motion
Without my love
Hey!
