Mama, take this badge off o' me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, much too dark to see you
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is going' down
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Mama wipe this blood from my face
I'm sick and tired of the war
Don't know if it's night or if this is sun, rising high
Scared of knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
