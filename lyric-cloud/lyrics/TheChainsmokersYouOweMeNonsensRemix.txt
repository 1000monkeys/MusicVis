I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me

You owe me
You owe me
You owe me
You owe me

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

You owe me
You owe me
You owe me
You owe me
