Love's
Got that taste
To say it now feels good on my tongue
Fear
Does horrible things
To good hearts, good lives alike and some

So never make it out alive
Make it out alive
Alive, ahh, ahh
Alive, ahh, ahh

Funny how
They do the same damn things
Motivation inside
Somewhere dark and deep
It latches on
Like a thief
Fear makes you run, and love helps you, breath

So never make it out alive
Make it out alive
Alive, ahh, ahh
Alive, ahh, ahh

Oooh the taste of just one kiss
I would jump at my own risk
Fear does not rule over my heart
Love is not short but worth every shot
Worth every shot

So never make it out alive
Make it out alive
Make it out alive
Make it out alive
So never make it out alive
Make it out alive
Make it out alive
So never make it out alive
So never make it out alive
Make it out alive
Make it out alive
Make it out alive
