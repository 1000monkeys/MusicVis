No I'm not gonna calm down
Can't see straight when you come around
You put your hands on me
All of my walls give up
Tumbling and tripping, I been there
Million miles a minute
I'm freaking out
Something's telling me this is love

If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
Like a river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
Like a river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
Can't keep up, keep up
Can't keep up

I can't keep it a secret
Going from wanting to needing
Water is rising
And I'm in over my head
Fill my lungs up, I breathe you
Skin on skin all the time
Slowly you pull me
I'm hanging by a thread, oh by a thread

If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
Like a river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
At the river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
Can't keep up, keep up
Can't keep up
Can't keep up
If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
Like a river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
Like a river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
Can't keep up
If my heart is working over time
And I don't, I don't, I don't know how it happened
Like a river running through my mind
Can't keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
