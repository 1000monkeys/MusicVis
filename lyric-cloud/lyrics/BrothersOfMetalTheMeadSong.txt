This is a song about death, mead and a goat
The Einherjars’ final preparation for Ragnarök
Welcome to the land of no hangovers!
If you are ruthless in battle so true
If chosen in death there is room for you too
By an army of Valkyries taken away
To the Hall of the Fallen
A feast awaits!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Another!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Yeah!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Into the mist the she-goat will us lead
(Mead!)
(Another!)
From Heidruns teats the endless stream of mead
Drink, brother, drink – there’s no need to think
We fight until we rise again
We drink until we fall
We kill each other every day
To the final battle call
We’re an army of warriors, vicious and strong
In the Hall of the Fallen
The feast goes on!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Another!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Yeah!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Into the mist the she-goat will us lead
(Mead!)
(Another!)
From Heidruns teats the endless stream of mead
Pour me another and you’ll be my brother!
When you are thirsty and hungry for fight
There’s no need to worry
There’s mead left and right
We’re an army so wasted
No mead is too strong
In the Hall of the Fallen
Hear our song!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Another!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Yeah!
(Mead!)
(Another!)
Into the mist the she-goat will us lead
(Mead!)
(Another!)
From Heidruns teats the endless stream of mead
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
(Mead!)
(Another!)
