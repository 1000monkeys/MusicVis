High or low, the people talking bout
All the smoke you keep on coughing out
More
Keep it up, it won't give back enough
Just keep up the curtain, all for the show
I'm held up down by the fault lines
I hear sounds, I swear it's coming on now

Take my hand, jump in the ocean
I swear that we'll keep on floating
Along

Now I'm sleepwalking so don't wake me up
I got everything just the way I want
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?

I know her, she's such a diva
Blew my word, I'd never leave it all
Outta luck and you've gone call her up
Left me all alone again and I hurt
Once it's make 
Once it's straight I can't ignore it, oh

I'd run over sea but you can't make up
You take the four leaf clover I want
Now I'm sleepwalking so don't wake me up
I got everything just the way I want
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Now I'm sleepwalking so don't wake me up
I got everything just the way I want
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?


Now I'm sleepwalking so don't wake me up
I got everything just the way I want
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?

Now I'm sleepwalking so don't wake me up
I got everything just the way I want
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?
Can't you see that I'm gone?
