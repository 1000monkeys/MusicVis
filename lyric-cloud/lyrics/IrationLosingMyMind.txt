I was on path but it started to get old
Thought about the past and it started getting cold
And I don't mind the rules just as long as I've been told
But living on the edge is starting to get dull
And I don't really mind being the safe bet
It's just that my brain is always messing with my head
Tell me to go fast when I need to take it slow
Telling me I'm good when I'm losing control

I still smile while it all falls down

Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes
And I'm done trying
Trying to make it rhyme
Living in the memory of another woken dream
Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes

Never been the type to go breaking the law
Don't know if what I see is actually what I saw
And I've been hearing things since the day that I was born
But voices in my head are louder than I let on
And I don't really mind life being so mundane
But there ain't nothing wrong with me walking in the rain
And there ain't nothing gone but my will to hold on
So I don't wanna stop living life until it's gone

I still smile while it all falls down

Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes
And I'm done trying
Trying to make it rhyme
Living in the memory of another woken dream
Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes

Have another round cuz the night is young
Make a toast to the rising sun
Can't change the past cuz what's done is done

Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes
And I'm done trying
Trying to make it rhyme
Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes
And I'm done trying
Trying to make it rhyme
Living in the memory of another woken dream
Losing my mind
Feels good sometimes

Losing my, losing my
Losing my mind
Losing my, losing my
Losing my mind
Feels good, feels good
Feels good sometimes
Losing my mind
Feels good
