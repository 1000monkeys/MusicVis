(feat. Diva Ice)
You can see me rising to your eyes
You can feel me flowing to the sky
Hell, rock the why ...
When we start to fly
We waling on air, walking on air, walking on air, walking on air
Ooh, ooh
Walking on air, walking on air, walking on air, walking on air
Ooh, ooh
You're all I need, I'm all you need
Walking on air, walking on air, walking on air, walking on air
Ooh, ooh
Walking on air
