Can we try again
Start a new and lovely story that will
Shine a ray of light upon our hearts
And bring back a long, lost glory
Of how it used to be
Baby, you and me
Convinced we were each other's destiny
My heart cries out to you
You must forgive me
I've been dancin' in the dark
Been searchin' for a spark
A fire still burning
I believe we'll make it through if you stand by me
We can weather any storm, and keep each other warm
As long as there's love
Every time I think of us, my eyes are filled with tears
To think that I gave in to sweet temptation
His words like music to my ears
I hope it's not too late
That you still await
Oh, please tell me that you're still having faith
My heart cries out to you
You must forgive me
I've been dancin' in the dark
Been searchin' for a spark
A fire still burning
I believe we'll make it through if you stand by me
We can weather any storm, and keep each other warm
As long as there's love
Faith is not mine
And if I could I'd undo
The hands of time
Oh, my heart cries out to you
You must forgive me
I've been dancin' in the dark
Been searchin' for a spark
I believe we'll make it through if you stand by me
We can weather any storm, and keep each other warm
As long as there's love
Neverendin' love
Love
