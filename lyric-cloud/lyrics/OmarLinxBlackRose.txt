See I've hit highs and felt lows
Held on and I've let go
Stood tall through bad calls
But I feel it all when we get close
And I wait for that
Swear to god I paid for that
My one hope
My downfall
My black rose

Are you okay? swimming in that open lake?
You see me there but you can't talk and that's my mistake
You drift away you missed the pain, you want it back (Why?)
You lick the wounds they never heal now here's the catch
That one seed, it sinks deep, it gets fed
It starts black, it turns blue, it bleed red
It knows you, destroys you, consumes you
It likes all that fun shit that you do
And so we wait, getting back to that solar state
You full of heart, you full of hate, you wanna lose, you know the way
Crush pills
, 
rolled bills
, ashing in that empty bottle
It's your brain and my cash, we all die, ain't that the motto
Ain't that the night that your looking for, ain't that the life?
What's out of mind, ain't out of sight so let's do it right
Fuck is wrong with your mind now
You fly high but I'm tied down
You've been lost in my life style
It's about time that you find out

My black rose, seen the way it grows (seen the way you grow) looking for the light (looking for the light)
My last hope, be happy on your way (help me in your way)
Let me stay with you, don't you wilt away (don't you go bad, don't you go bad)

Are you alright? Are you alive?
If you were mine I'd hold you tight, I'd take the time
I see the thrones, they're digging deep
They always did, I'm unamused
I'm tricked again, you pretty thing
The smallest lies, a subtle truth
If I fall apart for you, if I put these dreams in cue
If I sold it all and I'd start again there'd still be no room for two
My baby's on her own, my heart is running wild
What's here today, that's gone tomorrow, I find it hard to smile
And I'm stuck there, thoughts moving in slow-mo
Parked out with a dead flower, in the glove-box of a Volvo
Form a mess, and I hide it well
My mind's made, my cards dealt
My nerves bad, you can't tell
I'm ice cold but I've been through hell
I've been through worse, never mind what you think it's worth
Give it time and I'll let it bloom, my last laugh but I'll miss you first
Fuck is wrong with my mind now
You fly high but I'm tied down
I've been lost in my life style
It's about time that you find out

My black rose, seen the way it grows (seen the way you grow) looking for the light (looking for the light)
My last hope, be happy in your way (help me in your way)
Let me stay with you, don't you wilt away (don't you go bad)
But you wilt away (don't you got bad, don't you go bad) 
My black rose
