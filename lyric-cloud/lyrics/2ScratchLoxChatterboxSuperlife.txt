Ooh, shawty so high

Yeah
Shawty so high she pop a pill, now she call it Superlife, yeah
She want me come over, fuck her body, so she fuck me all the night, yeah
Bitches in the club sell their souls for a drive to cloud nine, yeah
Seems like they will do everything to feel a bit alive

Superlife, she gon live it twice
Nothing that she wouldn't do to try to feel alive
Superlife, don't care if it's right
She just wanna get a little taste of what it's like

S-S-Superlife she gon live that (Live that), if you broke she ain't with that (With that)
Super white she gon sniff that, tryna get too a high she can't get back (Get back)
When she call me up, I know what she want (Yeah), someone to get high with, somebody to fuck (Everytime)
They call it suicide (Suicide), I call it lost but she call it Superlife (Superlife)
[Chorus: 2Scratch & 
Lox Chatterbox
]
Yeah
Shawty so high she pop a pill, now she call it Superlife, yeah (
Superlife, Superlife, life
)
She want me come over, fuck her body, so she fuck me all the night, yeah
Bitches in the club sell their souls for a drive to cloud nine, yeah
Seems like they will do everything to feel a bit alive

Superlife
Ooh, Superlife
Superlife, Superlife

When she call me up, don't know what she want
Someone to get high with, somebody to fuck
They sayin' she crazy, they callin' it suicide
But I call it lost, she call it Superlife

Yeah
Shawty so high she pop a pill, now she call it Superlife, yeah
She want me come over, fuck her body, so she fuck me all the night, yeah
Bitches in the club sell their souls for a drive to cloud nine, yeah
Seems like they will do everything to feel a bit alive

It's Lox!
She's so high, you can see in both her eyes
She ain't even got emotions left, she ain't even got a pulse, don't try
You don't even wanna ask that girl, better make two feet four or five
Everybody knows she's superlit like supernovas in the sky
I think it's funny how a superficial girl keep tryna live a super superfucking life
She ain't even got a superfucking clue how to ever make it to the other side
She wanna be on film, supereight, she wanna make those mills, supersized
Tryna live a new life, few could taste, she just wanna live a Superlife

Superlife, she gon live it twice
Nothing that she wouldn't do to try to feel alive
Superlife, don't care if it's right
She just wanna get a little taste of what it's like
W-W-When she call me up, I know what she want
Someone to get high with, somebody to fuck
They sayin' she crazy, they callin' it suicide
But I call it lost, she call it Superlife

Yeah
Shawty so high she pop a pill, now she call it Superlife, yeah
She want me come over, fuck her body, so she fuck me all the night, yeah
Bitches in the club sell their souls for a drive to cloud nine, yeah
Seems like they will do everything to feel a bit alive

Superlife
Ooh, Superlife

Superlife, Superlife
