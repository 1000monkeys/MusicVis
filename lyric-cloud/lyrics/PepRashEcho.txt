I'm on the highest high
And it feels like flyin'
Flyin
We went to the edge
I almost give up tryin' (echo)
Tryin
I hear you call out of the blue
I reach out in the absence of you
I'm on the highest high
And it feels like flyin'
I hear the echooo
Hear the echooo
I hear the echooo
Echooo of you
Echooo of you
Many nights have past
And I have stopped counting
Still, I walk on water to keep us from drowning
I hear you call out of the blue
I reach out in the absence of you
I'm on the highest high
And it feels like flyin'
I hear the echooo
Hear the echooo
I hear the echooo
Echooo of you
I hear the echooo
Hear the echooo
I hear the echooo
Echooo of you
