Through the Milky way
In my spaceship
At the speed of light
I'm gonna make it
I know you've been expecting me
Turn on the cameras
Take another scene
We go like
Hands up people
Get with the show
We're taking over people
Lose control
Spin the decks, my DJ
Reach for my soul
Aim for the stars my people
We never fall
Yes I'm an alien
When I'm touching the Earth
Call me a spaceman
When I travel universe
Yes I'm an alien
When I'm touching the Earth
Call me a spaceman
When I travel universe
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Man
Call me a spaceman
Through the Milky way
In my spaceship
At the speed of light
I'm gonna make it
I know you've been expecting me
Turn on the cameras
Take another scene
We go like
Hands up people
Get with the show
We're taking over people
Lose control
Spin the decks my DJ
Reach for my soul
Aim for the stars my people
We never fall
Yes I'm an alien
When I'm touching the Earth
Call me a spaceman
When I travel universe
Yes I'm an alien
When I'm touching the Earth
Call me a spaceman
When I travel universe
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Man
Call me a spaceman
