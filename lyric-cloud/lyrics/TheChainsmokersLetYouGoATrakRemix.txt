You end up alone after all that you've done
All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
People don't think you know what you're made of
Oh
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say, it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
I'm seeing it through, can you not be hateful?
While we're alive
Can we relax that, that what our maids for?

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?
(Let the thing go)

You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it too, I'm trying to follow
I've been to hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go? (go) (go)
(Let the thing go)

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go
