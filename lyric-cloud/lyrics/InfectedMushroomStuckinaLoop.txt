I really wanna tell you why
Stop with the tears and lies
Stuck in a loop forever now
Playing in the silver nights
Save what was only mine
A fair view of you and I
I'm stuck in a loop forever now
Wish I could turn back time

I really wanna show you how
I stopped with the tears and lies
See any face so clearly now
Sometimes I think you're here somehow
We talk and we walk again
A day we knew no more pain
Stuck in a loop forever
Wish I could stop time now
