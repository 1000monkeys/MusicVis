Balcony overlooking the city of Los Angeles, never felt this lovely
Pacing back and forth for hours broke my peace anticipating don't let it budge me
I pray they listen before they judge me
Straight up I need to go on my own direction
Make my own selections
Retorted back it back with claims I'm turning my back on the homies who made it possible
For you to have a voice who looked out with nobody stopping you
Sure
Sugar coated protected perception
Don't want to break nobodies heart over truthful reflection
I shed some guilty tears moments after Thanksgiving dinner with Benavente rolling through Seaside
New adventures for this loner
Bringing it in 2015 with friends and coronas
Newer resolutions to feel this endless persona
Meanwhile
A couple interesting plots are thickenin' among you
Dinos back in the base
San Diego was home I guess you got some choices to choose
Blankets coming off the bed you made
The voice isnt true
They get to talkin' like you finished got some points you can prove
But lose when you set the record straight
Drunkin' nights in Studio City with Chip the Ripper
But fuck am I really
I broke it off with Cassandra
Shit was getting to silly
My muse from Oakland's been growing impatient
We've been at it for months
Too busy acting my rapper fantasies in a bunch
I started making rounds to Northern Cal this shit is wild
Oakland International
L.R.G attire construction Timberland boots, couldn't tell me I wasn't fashionable
Damn
Not to long ago when i was on board
Snap-backs, Jordan's, and chains became the highest oh lord
Hoping Logics fans will like me on tour
Searching Sylvan dropped and all I got was theories
On how the industry moves and advice I never asked for
A couple pointless meetings that fizzled with niggas  on the fence C step
Talkin shit that I swore I would never forget
Now them shoulders is feeling stretched
A couple rappers friends just stopped returning them texts
He spoke to Skizzy since I wrote down and asked for a check
I just thought it was all respect
But you know
Shout out to mickey too
Thought we was brothers but ego just made this shit defuse
Its funny when your mentors end up getting it misconstrue
Was once with the thought of feeling accepted
So breakdowns made me face the fear of rejection
Some prophecies I projected have manifested
I was only trying to mesh wit'
Legends who sought the throne but my guess is that these times are changing I should get with the shift
Made it back to Miami with grace
Just in time to escape
Whats Hollywood and  trapped inside this Quest persona
Too many expectations threatening Yoda
Where does it end
Sleepless nights  with my face in the mirror
Mommas words of wisdom helping me seein' it clearer
Nothing is destant better learn how to step in your full self
Im guessing ive been waitin' too long
Dont want to get in Gods way but hes been patient too long
Down the Henny when the taste is too strong
Asking questions that never mattered, distracting me from taking whats wrong
Out of his misery my faith has been torn
I reunited with pops
Hes still usin' but the hatred is gone
Nigga family is family
They say the key to harmony is to practice new understanding
And Ive been working on communication
Many broken relationships done with losing patients
A new sense of leadership man the crew has been waitin'
These wise ones need direction my truth is the pavement
Thinking bigger then ever
I got to keep it together
No time to treat this whatever
Fuck them prior engagements
I chose myself and still managed to dodge humiliation
The interest in reconciliation
Forgiveness
That chip on that nigga shoulder still present
Dont think that Ive lost my hunger
You gatta hear thunder to know a storm is coming
For real
This is Far from Familiar
I came a long way from ignoring blessings
Mamma in here interrupting recording sessions
I used to think my mountain was to hard to climb
But I just stepped up to the starting line


Well, well, well, you made it this far didn't you?
Alone you stood when it was highly advised not too
Through the trenches you fought
The most if not all will doubt you
You remember just in the nick of time
God has a way of swooping right before the last finger slips off the cliff
Self was found
In the most unfamiliar of circumstances
You now know who you are
You know where your going
God is still with you
The benefits of your faith your shall reap
When everyone question your 
No longer ifs, nor when
These notions have been tossed
You are more then ready to attain everything your hear desires
The question now
Is At what Cost?
Far From Familiar
