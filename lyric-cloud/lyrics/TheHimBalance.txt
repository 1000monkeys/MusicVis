They say watch and learn
Who can hustle hardest?
Who can shout the loudest?
I try to watch and learn, yeah
Guess I've been lacking
Never liked to practice

So, do I gotta change just to make a change?
To evolve my game or evaporate
Or do I follow my own, put my blindfold on?
Run the marathon, try to prove them wrong

Tell me what if there never was a truth
And everybody just gets what to do
Making it is just different points of view
Guess I'm trying to keep, trying to keep, my balance
My balance, my balance, my balance

So I walk the tightrope
Trying to be who I want
Trying to keep the lights on

So, do I gotta change just to make some change?
To assimilate or evaporate
Or do I follow my own, put my blindfold on?
Run the marathon, try to prove them wrong

Tell me what if there never was a truth
And everybody just gets what to do
Making it is just different points of view
Guess I'm trying to keep, trying to keep, my balance
My balance, my balance, my balance

Tell me what if there never was a truth
And everybody just gets what to do
Making it is just different points of view
Trying to keep, trying to keep my balance
