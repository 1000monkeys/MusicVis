Every time you talk to me
I see those big brown batters
You can almost guarantee
I'll be at a loss for words
Every time you walk my way
I get all flustered
I just don't know what to say
When I wanna flirt with you
Oh Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes
Oh gosh, oh get up, how'd they get so lit up
Gosh oh get up how'd they get that size
Every time you make a move
It's like I'm frozen
Cause you are oh so smooth, you got me paralyzed
Glad you set me in your sights cause you're so charming
When your look locks into mine
I'm still taken by surprise
Oh Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes
Oh gosh, oh get up, how'd they get so lit up
Gosh oh get up how'd they get that size
Oh Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes
Oh gosh, oh get up, how'd they get so lit up
Gosh oh get up how'd they get that size
Oh Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those peepers
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes
Oh gosh, oh get up, how'd they get so lit up
Gosh oh get up how'd they get that size
Oh those eyes
