I was backstage at a festival in Germany
Talking to a cute, fair-skinned brunette
I asked her if she wanted to have a beer
And if she liked our set
I noticed that her hair was longer in the back
I figured that's cause she's Canadian
That's why I was surprised when she told me she was fully lesbian
That's when I realized it was Sara
Or maybe it was Tegan
I'm pretty sure that it was Sara
Cause Johnny Samson said she was the cool one
I told her that I was a big fan of her band
She asked me if I had a favourite song
I admitted that I never actually heard them
But I like K.D. Lang
I told her this Jew knows about the Junos
And how they got robbed three times in a row
And then I asked her if she knew of anyone
Who's selling pills or blow
That's when I creeped out Sara
Or maybe I just pissed her
Off when I asked her if her sister
And her had ever had a threesome
Where they both ganged up on one girl
A fourgy or a fivesome
Do they think strap-ons are groovy
And had they ever seen the movie
"Bound", and did they like Jennifer Tilly?
Did they like Jennifer Tilly?
Sara said she
Preferred Gina Gershon
Angelina Jolie
In that "Gia" movie
That was on HBO
And "If These Walls Could Talk"
Made Tegan cry alot
After that I almost forgot what she said
That's the problem with Diazepam
So many things I don't remember
But I got a sinking feeling
It's not that I'm a clair-
-voyant but I think I creeped out Sara
I was creeping out on Sara
I hope it wasn't Tegan
Cause Skiba said she is the cooler one
