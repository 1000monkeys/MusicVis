[Verse 1: Trevor Wentworth & 
Matt Wentworth
]
I've been fighting the same old war
Against a disease, without a cure
Been holding on for so long (For so long, for so long)
I've been wishing upon a star, as my universe falls apart
I feel so far from the sky, as my dreams are flying by
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Wentworth & 
Trevor Wentworth
]
And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns
[Chorus: Trevor Wentworth & 
Matt Wentworth
]
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes
[Verse 2: Matt Wentworth & 
Trevor Wentworth
]
I've come too far to go back now, to turn into a face in the crowd
Been on this road, for so long (For so long, for so long)
Convinced there is no way out, my world is turned upside down
My sense of direction's been gone (For so long, for so long)
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Wentworth & 
Trevor Wentworth
]
And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns
[Chorus: Trevor Wentworth & 
Matt Wentworth
]
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes
[Bridge: Trevor Wentworth & 
Matt Wentworth
]
Stay strong, keep moving, can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on, we'll be the ones that pull the stars down to us
Stay strong, keep moving, can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on, we'll be the ones that pull the stars down to us
[Chorus: Trevor Wentworth & 
Matt Wentworth
]
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes
