The world was new
Something true
The thrill of youth
We were proof

Strobe lit rooms and dirty bars
Spending nights inside our cars
We were right inside our hearts
But we fell
Oh well

We raged in burned down places
Back when we were young
Breathed smoke into our faces
Back when we were young

Freshly faded, just emancipated
Too blind to realize
We were changing
Moved to different places in time
And all these

Strobe lit rooms and dirty bars
Spending nights inside our cars
We were right inside our hearts
But we fell
Oh well

We raged in burned down places
Back when we were young
Breathed smoke into our faces
Back when we were young

Delay, (na, na, na, na)

We try to stretch the time
We lost track of the nights
We slept away the days and hoped we'd never age

Strobe lit rooms and dirty bars
Spending nights inside our cars
We were right inside our hearts
But we fell
Oh well

We raged in burned down places
Back when we were young
Breathed smoke into our faces
Back when we were young

Delay, (na, na, na, na)
Fly, fly
I know you're taking
I want to see fly
I know you're taking if I
Fly
