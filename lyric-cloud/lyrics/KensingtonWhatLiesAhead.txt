Cold and broken down
It’s all I knew
I let it corner me in
And hide where my tracks lead
Now I’m waking up
And all I do
Is getting lost in the past
To find where I’d first hear

That I was never gonna be somebody
That I was never gonna feel light, come around
And they rise again as I am told that I should see

Red now
And to fear what lies ahead now
But I know that I will
Do everything for you again
I will do everything for you again
And I bet now
You will see that I will burn what I don’t need here
And I’ll know it’s alright, alright, alright
I’ll know it’s alright, alright, alright

How I faded out
’Cause I never knew
That all the thorns in my bed
Were passed down and taught me

That I was never gonna be somebody
That I was never gonna feel light come around
And they rise again as I am told that I should see

Red now
And to fear what lies ahead now
But I know that I will
Do everything for you again
I will do everything for you again
And I bet now
You will see that I will burn what I don’t need here
And I’ll know it’s alright, alright, alright
I know it’s alright, alright, alright

What if the years won’t come?
It’s caught up in my head
What if I’ll be outrun?
It haunts me down instead
It has gone one way
It was bound to break
And it all reminds me of a time I
Fooled around but now I’m fighting

Red now
And to fear what lies ahead now
But I know that I will
Do everything for you again
I will do everything for you again
And I bet now
You will see that I will burn what I don’t need here
And I’ll know it’s alright, alright, alright
I know it’s alright, alright, alright
