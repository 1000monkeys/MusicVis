House for you!
If I took the sand out of the hourglass
I could built a new beach for you
If I took the bricks out of the wall
And force to the ground
I could built a new house for you
House for you!
Sky for you!
Know for you!
If I took the sand out of the hourglass
I could built a new beach for you
If I took the bricks out of the wall
And force to the ground
I could built a new house for you
House for you!
If I took the blue from your Moon and use it too
I could put it in the sky for you
Sky for you!
I could take the smile from your eyes
And make it shine
I would hold it on long enough for you
Now for you
Let the words I've written
If I could work it from the???
I will hold the nights, the happy wives
Grasp and lift away, oh this world
Guarded by the sun that shines so bright
In this world
I take this coat, this???
I'll wrap it around you to keep you warm
I'll keep you warm, keep you warm
Let the words I've written
Let the words I've written
If I took the sand out of the hourglass
I could build a new beach for you
If I took the bricks out of the wall
And force to the ground
I could build a new house for you
I would take the blue from your Moon
And use it too
I could put it in the sky for you
I could take the smile from your eyes
And make it shine
I would hold it on long enough for you
