I spent my last dollar on a motherfucking cab
I remember when I was grindin' for a motherfucking bag, yeah
Check the checking account like what a motherfucking drag, damn
Ran away from my problems floating off a tab (Yeah)
My ex-girl got a new tan
And a pic on her IG with a new man
And I wanna be happy, she’s happy but damn, damn
My heart keeps fucking up the motherfucking plan, hey

Is this what you wanted?
We get drunk, we get high
We pop pills until the morning
We don't care, we don't mind
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?

All sizes and all ages
We sick in the mind, it’s contagious, yeah
I get off stage, the night rages
But I turn on the news and these kids in cages
Fuck
We're told not to trust our neighbors
We selling our soul to get famous
To escape it, we just get wasted
Induce pain, maintain, remain faceless
I'm just tryna get used to these changes
In the DM they claim save us
I see all the real shit that face us
But these people say, "Just entertain us, just entertain us"
Fuck it

Is this what you wanted?
We get drunk, we get high
We pop pills until the morning
We don't care, we don't mind
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?

You wanna watch me melt down
You wanna watch me drop dead
You wanna see me sell my soul
Believe all the lies that I've been fed
You wanna watch me give up
You wanna see me sedated
You deserve all you got coming, uh
I am the thing you created
Is this what you wanted?
I'll get drunk, I'll get high
I’ll pop pills until the morning
I don’t care, I don't mind
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?

Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
We get drunk, we get high
(Is this what you wanted?)
We pop pills until the morning
(You right)
We don’t care, we don't mind (Whoo!)
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?
