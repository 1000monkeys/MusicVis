Outer space, I'm out of reach
I can't hear the words you speak
You can scream and you can shout
I can't hear, over and out

In my spaceship time is short
From up here you look so small
To this lonely astronaut
Earth is just a tiny ball

Outer space, I'm out of reach
I can't hear the words you speak
You can scream and you can shout
I can't hear, over and out

(Outer space, I'm, outer space, I'm, Outer space, I'm...)
You can scream and you can shout
I can't hear, over and out

I can't hear, over and out

Outer space, I'm out of reach
I can't hear the words you speak
You can scream and you can shout
I can't hear, over and out

In my spaceship time is short
From up here you look so small
To this lonely astronaut
Earth is just a tiny ball

Outer space, I'm out of reach
I can't hear the words you speak
You can scream and you can shout
I can't hear, over and out

(Out, out, out...)
(Outer space, I'm, outer space, I'm, Outer space)
Outer space

I can't hear, over and out
