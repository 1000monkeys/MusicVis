There's no difference between you and I
We share the same sunshine from the same sky
When it rains, it rains on both you and I
Gotta sink or swim, now it's do or die

Even when I'm on my last breath

'Till we get reciprocity
How can we stand by?
Yesterday, I turned on the TV
I saw another man down
He was screaming
He can't breathe no more
He held his hands high
But then he got struck down
Oh, he got struck down

I saw the body drop
On the 6 o'clock
I saw the body drop
On the 6 o'clock
Struck down, struck down

There's no difference between you and I
Same space in time that we occupy
We all just looking for a piece of the pie
We went blind, going eye for an eye

It goes

I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
Try to burn me down
Get this whole place lit
I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
They said they want war, this is it

Let the body drop
Then let the body drop
Then let the body drop
Then let the body drop
