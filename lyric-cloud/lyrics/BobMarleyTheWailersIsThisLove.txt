I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah!
For Jah provide the bread

Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
I want to know - want to know - want to know now!
I got to know - got to know - got to know now!
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I - I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table!

I want to love you - I want to love and treat -
Love and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together, yeah! -
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah, oh now! -
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah! -
For Jah provides the bread

Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Wo-o-o-oah! Oh yes, I know; yes, I know - yes, I know now!
Yes, I know; yes, I know - yes, I know now!
Yes I, yes I - I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table!

See, I want to love you - I want to love and treat you -
Love and treat you right

We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed

We'll share the shelter, of my single bed
We'll share the same room...
