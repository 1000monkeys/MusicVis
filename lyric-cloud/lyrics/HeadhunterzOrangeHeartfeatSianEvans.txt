There's a dragon inside
You can no longer hide
With a burning desire
Rise up from the fire
With the power of truth
And the beauty of freedom
Reach up for the sky
'til we see the Orange Sun
Burning heart, tear me apart
Raising me up, up
To the Orange Sun
Orange Heart
And you can no longer hide
From the dragon inside
Rise up from the fire
With the power of truth
And the beauty of freedom
Reach up for the sky
'til we see the Orange Sun
Feel it beat beneath your skin
Come together and begin
Celebrating, we can make it
Hear the calling from within
It's our moment, it's our time
To awake and come alive
Undivided, we can fight it
Fight the dragon deep inside your
Burning heart, tear me apart
Raising me up, up
To the Orange Sun
Out of the dark
Lighting the spark
Starting a fire
That burns in our heart
Orange Heart
