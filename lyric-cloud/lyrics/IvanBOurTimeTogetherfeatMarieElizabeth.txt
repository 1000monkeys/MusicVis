And maybe someday it's me and you
But right now I can't seem to feel it too
Lately, all I know is you're running through my mind
I know it hurts, it's just not our time

I'm used to it all
I'm used to finding someone, then go losing it all
Tell 'em that I'm fine, don't you worry at all
Pick up my phone at 1 AM, and now I'm sending a call
Caring less and less around me, all my time has been around you
Let you in when you told me not to, held your hand, I said, "I got you"
Ocean in your eyes, I've been lost at sea
Drowning in my thoughts, it was you and me
And I can't seem to find a single silver lining
Tell you that I'm fine, I'm lying, a heart will never wait for time
And don't you get it? There's a reason I met you
You don't think that I get you?
Ask me why I'm trying, 'cause I think that you're special
Embedded in my mind, only you, nobody else
So many times you said there's somebody else
But you still picked up my calls, you still replied to my texts
I went and made you a song, you said it made you a mess
'Cause the cracks in your heart, it looked just like mine
You and I were broken around the same time
Beautiful smile with all the pain in your eyes
You have a love so deep, you trust the wrong guys
And I understand it more than anyone
You're not looking for connection with just anyone
What if I told you that I'm the better one?
Spilling all my heart and I'ma let it run
My mind is saying, "Leave you", but my heart says, "No"
You made your choice, but I can't seem to let go
Thinking of your voice in a world so cold
I'm breaking down now, but I won't let it show
And even if I'm crazy, doesn't mean that I'm wrong
Wonder what you're thinking as you listen to this song
I've been lost in my mind, but I'ma tell you I'm fine
But what's the point of "The One" if you find 'em at the wrong time, like

And maybe someday it's me and you
But right now, I can't seem to feel it too
Lately, all I know is you're running through my mind
I know it hurts, it's just not our time
Baby, don't you tell me that you don't see it too
You say you love me, so then tell me what can I do?
You're on my mind, I know it hurts, it's just not our time

I can tell you've been crying, let me shoulder your pain
You're looking at me funny, do you know what you're saying?
"Ivan this isn't a game, I can't be feeling the same
I told you not to fight for anything, there's nothing to gain
And now things are harder, 'cause I'm feeling it too
There was a wall for a reason, why'd you go and break through?
Then you made me a song and it's been all in my mind
I know you're lying every time when you tell me you're fine
I met this guy before I met you
Put my trust in him before I met you
I got attached to him before I met you
Now you're on my mind ever since I met you, but what can I do?
'Cause I don't think that you're getting it
A few months earlier with you and maybe this would be different
Maybe you do really get me and that's the thing that upsets me
I want him, I'm in your mind, so it's best you forget me"
Maybe you're right, I don't think I'll ever get it, love is making me blind
Picking up the phone, then I'm putting it down
Like who am I to go ruin the happiness that you found?
I kept going to tell my friends that it was all so dumb
Then I'm writing in my room until my heart goes numb
Till my pens all done, you know my heart wants more
Let's break it in pieces all again once more
You can tell me that I'm wasting all my time
But I've been looking for a sign, and I've been finding it in you
And you can tell me he was there first, you can say you fell for him first
He'll never look at you the way I look at you
You left a hole in my chest that I don't think I can fill
It's like we met in a dream, but the feeling is real
And I can write a thousand lines, all the stars could align
What's all the love in the world if you find it at the wrong time?

And maybe someday it's me and you
But right now I can't seem to feel it too
You're on my mind, I know it hurts, it's just not our time
