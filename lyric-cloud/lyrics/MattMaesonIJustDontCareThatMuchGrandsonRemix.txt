My teeth are rottin' away
I've leathered all my skin
And my blood is gettin' thin
And my whole fuckin' character's changed
I don't know who I used to be
But it certainly isn't me
Any more and more I drink, I am afraid
That I'm just killin' myself
Got me fearin' for my health
I'm scared that Hell is just a place on Earth
And I pray to God I leave
Before Satan pours another drink

I'm just living like the man
I'm just living like the man on fire (Fire, fire)
I just don't care that much
I'm just living like the man
I'm just living like the man on fire (Fire, fire)
I just don't care that much

Combustible, confused, and free
I no longer see that coast
That I always used to see
And I think it drifted far from me
Why am I talkin' to a ghost
That I've never even seen
When I haven't even heard you speak?
You said the months go by so quick
Maybe you're just full of shit
You'll never last, I'm sorry I just said that
Maybe life was just a bet
That I lost to drugs and cigarettes

I'm just living like the man
I'm just living like the man on fire (Fire, fire)
I just don't care that much
I'm just living like the man
I'm just living like the man on fire (Fire, fire)
I just don't care that much

In my mind, I will wander and wait
'Til I see your fire escape

I'm just living like the man
I'm just living like the man on fire
I just don't care that much
I'm just living like the man
I'm just living like the man on fire
I just don't care that much
