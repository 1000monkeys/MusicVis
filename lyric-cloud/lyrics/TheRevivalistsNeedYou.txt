I don't need you, brain, playing tricks on me
I don't need you, double vision, that which I sometimes see
I don't need you, heart, always beating on me
I don't need you pit in my stomach
I don't need you shaky knees

I don't need you
I don't need you, me
I don't need you
You need me
Need me

I don't need you, legs, refusing to stand
I don't need you blood boiling
I don't need you grabbing hands
I don't need you, lungs, always getting out of breath
I don't need you bloodshot eyes, refusing me my rest

I don't need you
I don't need you, me
I don't need you
You need me

You need me
You need me
You need mee
I don't need you
You need me
I can't live without you, no no no
I don't need you
I don't need you
I can't live without you
You need me
You need me


I don't need you
You need me
I don't need you
I don't need you
You need, me
You need, me, me
