You could be the light that shines tonight
I let you lead the way to paradise
Felt alive through your eyes
We can dive into the sky
You could be the light that shines tonight

I let you lead the way to paradise
Felt alive, through your eyes
We can dive into the sky
You could be the light that shines tonight


You could be the light that shines tonight
I let you lead the way to paradise
Felt alive, through your eyes
We can dive into the sky
You could be the light that shines tonight

You could be the light that shines tonight
I let you lead the way to paradise
Felt alive, through your eyes
We can dive into the sky
You could be the light that shines tonight
