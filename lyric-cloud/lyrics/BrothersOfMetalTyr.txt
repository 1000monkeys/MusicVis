One arm, one fist
One battle in the night
So pale, so stiff
Defeated by Tyr and his might
The raging thunder strikes
May gods be with us
My sword of doom is wet
Around me blood, tears and death
My god of justice (in your name)
Guide me to victory (and pain)
Remember the fallen (Fall of the Brave)
Make it your day
(Hey! Hey!)
For Tuesday
(Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!)
It’s Tuesday
(Hey! Hey!)
It’s Tyr
My arm, its feast
Great jaws of fire
So brute, this beast
Blood he desires
In moonlight Fenrir cries
I stole his freedom
Now Gleipnir holds him tight
Made out of spittle and breath
My god of justice (in your name)
Guide me to victory (and pain)
Remember the fallen (Fall of the Brave)
Make it your day
(Hey! Hey!)
For Tuesday
(Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!)
It’s Tuesday
(Hey! Hey!)
It’s Tyr
My god of justice (in your name)
Guide me to victory (and pain)
Remember the fallen (Fall of the Brave)
Make it your day
(Hey! Hey!)
For Tuesday
(Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!)
It’s Tuesday
(Hey! Hey!)
It’s Tyr
