Walking down the street, everybody looks at me
Shotgun in my pants is what they want to see
My bum is like a trigger, baby, waiting to explode
Come on, lets get funky, and make the party flow

Shotgun in the bum
Bang, bang, baby
(Disco, di-di-disco, party)
Shotgun in the bum
Bang, bang, baby
(Disco, funky party, yeah)
Shotgun in the bum
Bang, bang, baby
(Disco, di-di-disco, party)
Shotgun in the bum
Bang, bang, baby
(Disco, funky party, yeah)

Oooh, baby, I wanna see your bum (disco, di-di-disco)
Oh! Oooh, baby, your pretty, pretty bum (disco, di-di-disco party)
Oooh, baby, I wanna see your bum (disco, di-di-disco)
Oooh, baby, and destroy it with my gun

Shotgun in the bum
Bang, bang, baby
