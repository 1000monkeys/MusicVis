Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene oh, oh, oh

I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
I  always let it get to my head

All your appeal, once again with feeling
Higher education making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense

I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head

I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
Cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
Always let it get to my head
