Yuh ay what you talking about
Everything I have I put that on God
He my everything yuh yuh yuh yuh

I was a ghost in your mad house
Only echo my views from a distance
See I don't think you cared or listened
Until I came up with that vision
Haters talk a lot they be running they mouth
They gon' quiet down when the music load yeah
I'm a hustle hard make my momma proud
Every blessing here yuh I gotta thank God
Thank God Thank God

Every week I put in work
Hit a rapper with a verse
Sunday morning go to church
Loving my neighbor's the word ay
Fake ones tryna stunt
Keep it wavy from the jump
Never sell out for the funds
Gotta do more while I'm young ay
I've been making records day to day
People come up and they fade away
Lil' rapper's tryna ride the trends
I'm a trendsetter tryna make a way
First single I was dropping same waves
Second record I go super saiyan
Third record like a time machine
Star Wars with the trilogy
I was making songs for my ex
Ranting like my name was Kanye West
But I Gary V I finesse
Blessings on the way I don't stress
Paint the house Miyagi
My crew like wasabi
I am a son of the king
Call me Bobby
Set free like I'm Dobby
I know this my calling
I body my demons
They Drago I'm Rocky

I was a ghost in your mad house
Only echo my views from a distance
See I don't think you cared or listened
Until I came up with that vision
Haters talk a lot they be running they mouth
They gon' quiet down when the music load yeah
I'm a hustle hard make my momma proud
Every blessing here yuh I gotta thank God
Thank God Thank God

Thank God I stayed consistent even when I met the struggle
Thank God my ball coach taught me how to hustle
Thank God my dad taught me to go harder then go harder
This the come up I'ma make it and I put that on my momma
I gotta message he's called me to say if you ain't with it get out of my way
If you ain't with it you probably with him the enemy trying to keep me away
But I've got faith that I'm gon' rise and I'm gon' thrive cuz it's 'bout time
Somebody was light pointing to life pointing to freedom and pointing to Christ
Used to say I was the worst now they callin' me for verses
Words came back to bite and now they choking on they curses
So many open doors now I never could've earned
He gave me a crown even though I didn't deserve it
I was writing songs about me
Thank God he came in and intervened
Amazing grace I was blind now I see
Thank God Thank God I'm free

I was a ghost in your mad house
Only echo my views from a distance
See I don't think you cared or listened
Until I came up with that vision
Haters talk a lot they be running they mouth
They gon' quiet down when the music load yeah
I'm a hustle hard make my momma proud
Every blessing here yuh I gotta thank God
Thank God Thank God

God is so good
Like so good
