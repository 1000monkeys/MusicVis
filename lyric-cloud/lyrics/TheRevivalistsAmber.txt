Amber I can hear the sound
Watchin' over you
Watchin' over you
I know you can break the spell
Possibly true
Possibly true

Amber I can hear the sound
Watchin' over you
Watchin' over you
And I know you can break the spell
It’s possibly true
It’s possibly true

I know you’re just like me
You want a piece of the party
I can’t take it right now
I know you’re just like me
You want a piece of the party
But I can’t take it right now

Yeah I’m hoppin' on a plane tonight
I don’t know where I’m gonna go, no
Somewhere to get my feelings right
So much she doesn’t
I never took that easy way
And I don’t care about that open road
My heart’s well worn bad
And it’s chillin' in a rusty pool

Amber I can hear the sound
Watchin' over you
Watchin' over you
I know you can break the spell
It’s possibly true
It’s possibly true

I know you’re just like me
You want a piece of the party
I can’t take it right now
I know you’re just like me
You want a piece of the party
But I can’t take it right now
I know you’re just like me
You want a piece of the party
I can’t take it right now
I know you’re just like me
You want a piece of the party
I can’t take it
I can’t take it
I can’t take it

I’ll see you through the night
I’ll see you through the fight, oh
I’ll see you through the night
I’ll see you through the fight, oh
I’ll see you through the fight, yeah
I’ll see you
I’ll see you through the fight
I’ll see you through the fight
