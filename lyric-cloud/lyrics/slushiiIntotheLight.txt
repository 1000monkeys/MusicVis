The summer of light. It's a phenomenon that only occurs twice in every human's life; once during the beginning and once during the end. The color and magnitude of light varies from individual to individual, but everyone possesses this sacred light within, the light that remains a beacon of hope for generations to come.

Don't you ever wish you could go back?

One, two, three, woo!
