What are we all living for
If nothing's worth dying for tonight?
Your dreams are not enough, what I need is love
That's worth laying down my life

Sing along, just like they taught us
It's soothing your mind, this lullaby
No heaven above us
Just mile after mile of empty sky

No right or wrong, can you imagine?
A world where there's no more need to cry
But no joy or passion
It seems that the price is much to high

But I am holding out for something real

And though you offered peace
What I really need comes to so much more
Your dreams are not enough
What I need is love that's worth dying for

You say that you're a dreamer, well I'm a dreamer too
But I won't sing your lullaby
However well-intentioned, it's neither good nor true
The pallid dream is just a lie
It's just a lie!

But I am holding out for something real

And though you offered peace
What I really need comes to so much more
Your dreams are not enough
What I need is love that's worth dying for

What are we all living for
If nothing's worth dying for tonight?
