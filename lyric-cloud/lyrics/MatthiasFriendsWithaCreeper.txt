I'm friends with a creeper
That lives in my world
You can call me a weirdo
A loser a nerd
Stop trying to save me
By swinging your sword
You think I'm crazy
By risking my safety

From the very day I spawned
Into this world from the next
You could say I was nothing better
Than an ugly train wreck
Started out with nothing, no one
Not fun punching wood blocks
In the burning sun, when you're done
You take a hit
‘Cause it's not like it's
Like I got a wife and kids
To enjoy it with
Queue in my friend
Charging toward me
Sword drawn, let's go
It's on!
Thought I was under attack
But it turns out he too
Just wanted a friend
To watch his back
Turns out he too
Just wanted a friend
To watch his back

I'm friends with a creeper
That lives in my world
You can call me a weirdo
A loser a nerd
Stop trying to save me
By swinging your sword
You think I'm crazy by risking my safety
It's no big deal

It's easy to say you're my friend
When all the hard work is done
But where were you when I built myself
From the ground up?
Working and working and slaving away
No one was here
Except this creeper to stay
Best friends representing
What it takes to fight strong
And not bend
‘Cause he can depend on me
And me on him
Through the thick and the thin
And the truth is
We've grown closer
Than anyone could have ever imagined
They think our friendship is hopeless and tragic
They say he'll blow
I don't think it will happen
‘Cause I'm no longer saddened
Or feeling abandoned
Nor shocked by the magic
It's just I'm in traction
‘Cause I can't believe this is actually happening
Start with a cabin
Built our way to a mansion
‘Till we defeat
The ender dragon

I'm friends with a creeper
That lives in my world
You can call me a weirdo
A loser a nerd
Stop trying to save me by swinging your sword
You think I'm crazy by risking my safety
It's no big deal
