It's hard to give a damn about the sticks or stones
When all my bones been shook so long
And the ghost inside my head it keeps a floating on
And all night long I pray him gone

Like ooooooh ooooooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep
Ooooooh ooooooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep

Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes

Been dancing in the gallows just to lose myself
I've come undone I need some help
And I'm sick of throwing pennies in the wishing well
Cause everyone goes straight to hell

Like ooooooh ooooooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep
Ooooooh ooooooh
Think I've forgotten how to sleep

Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes
Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
I'm fighting with the beast inside

Oh I don't wanna close my eyes
Cause I just wanna stay alive
I'm fighting with the beast inside
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes
