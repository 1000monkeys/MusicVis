I wanna net this, it's on my chest
Won't let my guard down, no, not again
It wears my bones out, like sizzling stones
Won't let my guard down, leave me alone

I-I-I won't make it out alive, ay, ay
I-I-I just like the way it hurts
When the fire burns me
When the fire burns me
When the fire burns me
You know that
I-I-I won't make it out alive

When the fire burns
When the fire burns
When the fire burns
When the fire burns me

You know that
I-I-I won't make it out alive, ay, ay
I-I-I just like the way it hurts
You know that
I-I-I won't make it out alive, ay, ay
I-I-I just like the way it hurts

When the fire burns
When the fire burns
When the fire burns
When the fire burns me

I'm burning up
It's not enough h-high
I'm burning up
It's not enough h-high
I'm burning up
It's not enough h-high
I'm burning up
It's not enough
It's not enough

You know that
I-I-I won't make it out alive, ay, ay
I-I-I just like the way it hurts

When the fire burns
When the fire burns
When the fire burns
When the fire burns me
When the fire burns
When the fire burns me
When the fire burns
