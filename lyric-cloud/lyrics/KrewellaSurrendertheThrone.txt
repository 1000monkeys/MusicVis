Can you hear the sirens?
We're coming for your crown
There's fire on the horizon
Your walls are crashing down
We came to break the silence
We're knocking at your door
Cause for every broken promise
Is a desperate cry for war

Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne

Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne

Are you in the shadows?
Denial's chasing you
The truth is hard to swallow
But only for the fools
So look inside the mirror
And tell me what you see
A picture perfect hero
But you're no god to me

Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne

Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne

Throne
Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne

Surrender the throne
Surrender the throne (back down)
Surrender the throne (back down)
