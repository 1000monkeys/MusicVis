Took me down, had me feeling alone
So long, darlin'
Right here and now, we can try this again
If you're in, I'm in, darlin'

I finally see what I need to be free
Far from what I was lead to believe
No holding back, I've made up my mind
Seeing what's next, I'm not sure what I'll find
Holding the key firmly in my hands
I'm looking forward, I know where I stand
And this is it, I have nothing to lose
Now is the right time, I'm making my move

I'm on a high now
You can't bring me down
I'm on a high now
You can't bring me down, no

Holding the key firmly in my hands
I'm looking forward, I know where I stand
And this is it, I have nothing to lose
Now is the right time, I'm making my move

I'm on a high now
You can't bring me down
I'm on a high now
You can't bring me down, no

I'm seeing what's next, what is ahead
I'm seeing what's next
I'm seeing what's next, what is ahead
I'm seeing what's next

I'm on a high now
You can't bring me down
I'm on a high now
You can't bring me down, no
