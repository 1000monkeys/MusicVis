And you can tell me lies
Taste my mind, ta-ta-taste my mind
But I won't take it laying down
I won't take it laying down
And they can take my mind, put me last
Or push the line, push the line
But they can never stop this fire love

They won't bring me down, put these shackles on
They won't bring me down, they won't hold me, no
And they can push, push, push the line
And they can push, push, push the line
But they won't bring me down, they won't bring me down

And you can tell me lies, tell me lies
Taste my mind, ta-ta-taste my mind
And you can put me last or push the line
But I won't take it laying down

They won't bring me down, put these shackles on
They won't bring me down, they won't hold me, no
And they can push, push, push the line
And they can push, push, push the line
But they won't bring me down, they won't bring me down

They won't bring me down
They won't bring me down

(Woo-oh-oh)
(Woo-oh-oh)
Push the line

They won't bring me down, put these shackles on
They won't bring me down, they won't hold me, no
And they can push, push, push the line
And they can push, push, push the line
But they won't bring me down, they won't bring me down
They won't bring me down
Push the line
