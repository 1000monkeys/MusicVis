I, I still feel the pain on morphine, yeah
I feel my bones break under me, yeah
I, I’m still waiting on some relief, yeah
I, I still feel the pain on morphine, yeah

I fill a cup with my wasted dreams
It's numbing me
And if I press a fantasy
Into a pill, it seems
All my problems go away
Not for long, it's temporary
I given up on sobriety
To put it mildly
And if I’m acting wildly
Don't try and fight with me
Please don't make me pull away
'Cause I might make a big mistake
If I say what I mean
Will it scare you away, will it turn you away?
If I broke down my dreams
Would you even listen?
Don't know what I'm wishing

Oh, morphine
Oh, morphine
Woahh-ohh, woahh-oh, wooah

I, I still feel the pain on morphine, yeah
I feel my bones break under me, yeah
I, I’m still waiting on some relief, yeah
I, I still feel the pain on morphine, yeah

And hold your bitter tongue, yeah
I hold my bitter tongue, yeah
And hold your bitter tongue, yeah
Give another dose of
Morphine, can I have some more, please?
Wanna be numb forever
In a slump forever
Dopamine please
Somebody release me
Wanna be numb forever
In a slump forever

Oh, morphine
Oh, morphine
Woahh-ohh, woahh-oh, wooah

I, I still feel the pain on morphine, yeah
I feel my bones break under me, yeah
I, I’m still waiting on some relief, yeah
I, I still feel the pain on morphine, yeah
