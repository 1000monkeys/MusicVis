Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

I could never find the right way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
'Cause I left behind the home that you made me
But I will carry it along

Mm, it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know our names or our faces
But they will carry on for us

Mm, it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's-
Ayy, I will, ahh, hum huh
Ayy, I will, ayy, it's
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

Oh it's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until...
