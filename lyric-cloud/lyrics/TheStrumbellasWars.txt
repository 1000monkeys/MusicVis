I climbed a mountain and never came back
I will not quit, and I always fight back
And from this moment, for all my life
What could I say
I was born to be this way
And what could I say
Just living for today

And from a small town, our hard-working folks
Were all born rich and we all died broke
And from this moment, forever I can hope
What could I say
They were born to be this way
And what could I say
We're just living for today

And we all know that the sun will shine
I must go and chase this dream of mine
And I know I can do you proud
When I'm high above those clouds, at all

I don't sing well, but I got a lot of heart
This world's a pirate, and I'm swimming with the sharks
And in the sunlight, I'm shaking like it's dark
What could I say
I was born to be this way
And what could I say
I'm just living for today

We all know that the sun will shine
I must go and chase this dream of mine
And I know I can do you proud
When I'm high above those clouds
We all know that the sun will shine
I must go and chase this dream of mine
And I know I can do you proud
When I'm high above those clouds

And I can't sleep, but I'm fine
There's a soldier, soldier in my mind
And I can't sleep, but I'm fine
There's a soldier, soldier in my mind
There's a soldier, soldier in my mind
There's a soldier, soldier in my mind
There's a soldier, soldier in my mind
There's a soldier, soldier in my mind

We all know that the sun will shine
I must go and chase this dream of mine
And I know I can do you proud
When I'm high above those clouds
We all know that the sun will shine
I must go and chase this dream of mine
And I know I can do you proud
When I'm high above those clouds
