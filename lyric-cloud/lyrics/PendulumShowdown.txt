Well, it's been such a long time coming
I thought you'd understand
That I'm so far ahead of the lines
You've been drawing in the sand
'Cause it's simple
You were wrong
You must have known that we did not belong
I know you thought I sold my soul
But you never told me to my face
I just had to leave you cold
And blow this shit away
(Here we go again)
