I can feel the weight
I can feel the weight of the world
I can feel the pressure
I know the pain and the hurt

I've been climbing up all these mountains for so long
And I've been building up all these kingdoms for so long
But I will never run when destiny comes
I'm dipping my hand in gold

It's good to be king
It's good to be king

The crown is getting heavy
But they've written my name in the stars
For diamonds and castles
I've dealt blood and greed and scar

I've been climbing up all these mountains for so long
And I've been building up all these kingdoms for so long
But I will never run when destiny comes
I'm dipping my hand in gold

It's good to be king
It's good to be king
It's good to be king
It's good to be king

Like a conqueror
Like a conqueror
It's good to be king
Like a conqueror
It's good to be king
Like a conqueror

It's good to be king
It's good to be king
It's good to be king
It's good to be king
