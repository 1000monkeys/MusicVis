Blinding lights
Thunder tremble pack
Muddy hearts
Beanie babies lies
There's no lullaby
In this nowhere land
Shining high
Rumbles in the dark
Torn apart
Devil in disguise

There's no lullaby
In this nowhere land

What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
So alone

Tumbling dice
Sentimental crap
Who's the smart
Leading daily cries?

There's no lullaby
In this nowhere land

What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
So alone


What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
So alone
Who said you're on your own?
