Go figure pull the trigger while I simmer in the sun
Tell my lady I'll be with her when the summer's come and gone
You are the moon on the rise, you are my tide, you are the one
Sing the song of creation and an anthem for the young
In my next life
Could I take another turn?
Surrender
Surrender
Two eyes make the prize, live the life I know why
Dove cries, stars shine, and I fly through the night
With my sights set on the next bet, my life is not set yet
I got no regrets cause to get where I'm going
Could I take another turn?
Could I burn another day?
Could I move like a prince, slay the dragons in my way?
I'll be dancing in the wilderness 'til my dying day
I'll be dancing on the grave of the brave I have slayed
In my next life
Surrender
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender (my vision)
We run for the mountains, we will run for our lives
Say you are a nation of slaves with no sight
But I surrender my vision to your glory
It's the story of a silent sky
Ancient eyes, new baby blues, and old brown horizon
I surrender to your glory
(I surrender)
My vision
Glory to the king of creation
Surrender
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender (my vision)
Surrender
