So I take this knife
And cut you out of my life
So I erase this night
And rewrite you out of my mind
The phone is off the hook
The keys are down the drain
Just an empty book
With nothing on the page
I no longer have the voice to say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Oh in my mind
You won't be in my mind
You won't be in my mind

These scenes on repeat
Can't see the road in front of me
So I crash my car
On the way to the temple of your heart
The covers off the bed
The keys are down the drain
Just an empty head
With nothing left to say
I no longer have the strength to keep it alive, alive, alive

Oh in my mind
You won't be in my mind
You won't be in my mind

So maybe if I find another baby
Maybe if I get a house on the west coast with somebody else
Maybe if I settle down
Maybe if I sell out, maybe then

Oh in my mind
You won't be in my mind
You won't be in my mind
