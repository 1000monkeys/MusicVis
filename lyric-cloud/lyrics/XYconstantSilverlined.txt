If your heart tells you yea
Don't look back
I'm not far from a fool but relax
Anything goes if we're up for
The fight
'Cause everytime I'm with you
We are silverlined
If your heart tells you yea
Don't look back
I'm not far from a fool but relax
Anything goes if we're up for
The fight
'Cause everytime I'm with you
We are silverlined
Everytime I'm with you
Everytime I'm with you
Silverlined
Everytime I'm with you
Everytime I'm with you
Every moment I'm with you the rain stops
And we're silver
Every second I'm near you my heart stops
And I shiver
'Cause you, you bathe me in sunlight and
Rainfall
Yea you, you say me one word and we're
Silver
If your heart tells you yea
Don't look back
I'm not far from a fool but relax
Anything goes if we're up for
The fight
'Cause everytime I'm with you
We are silverlined
Silverlined
Silverlined
Everytime I'm with you we are
Silverlined
Silverlined
Silverlined
Everytime I'm with you we are
Silverlined
Every time I'm with you
Every time I'm with you
Silverlined
Everytime I'm with you
Every time I'm with you
Silverlined
Every moment I'm with you the rain stops
And we're silver
Every second I'm near you my heart stops
And I shiver
'Cause you, you bathe me in sunlight and
Rainfall
Yea you, you say me one word and we're
Silver
If your heart tells you yea
Don't look back
I'm not far from a fool but relax
Anything goes if we're up for
The fight
'Cause every time I'm with you
We are silverlined.
