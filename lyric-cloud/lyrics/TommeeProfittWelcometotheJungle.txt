Listen to me when I say
This will never go away
Hide, hide
Listen to me when I say
They will never go away
Run, run
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Listen to me when I say
This will never go away
Listen to me when I say
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
You can feel it too
Somebody’s watching you
You can feel it too
Somebody’s watching you
You can feel it too
Somebody’s watching you
Welcome to the jungle
