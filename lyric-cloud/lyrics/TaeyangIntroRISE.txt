Throw your hands in the air
Keep your hands in the air
We're gonna be reaching for the sky tonight
And we're gonna light it up
Rise tonight
Throw your hands in the air
Keep your hands in the air
Put it in the air
Feel it in the air
Alone in the darkness
It's so cold and crazy
And everybody's heartless
Got no one to save me
But fuck it, I'mma be alright
Wake up and rise
Baby, I'm the one
To light it up
Hotter than the burning sun
Every time that people say it's the end
I will show I'm forever
If you can't see it in my eyes
If you don't recognize
Then whatever
Let me say, ay!
Shout it out to the world, ay!
Get ready, I'm coming
Reaching for the sky tonight
Together we're gonna rise with the morning light
Throw your hands in the air
Keep your hands in the air
We're gonna be reaching for the sky tonight
And we're gonna light it up
Rise tonight
Throw your hands in the air
Keep your hands in the air
Put it in the air
Feel it in the air
