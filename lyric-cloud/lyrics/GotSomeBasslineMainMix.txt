This is my bassline, my bassline
Move, move your waistline to my bassline
Heard it through the great vine, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
Move, move your waistline to my bassline
Heard it through the great vine, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
Please turn off your mobile phone
And listen to your speaker phone
Get into the bass zone, feel it in your backbone
Yesterday is long gone, this will be our marathon
Don't go, stay here, hang on
4, 3, 2, 1
Bass, bass, bass, bass
Bass, bass, bass, bass
This is my bassline, my bassline
Move, move your waistline to my bassline
Heard it through the great vine, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
Move, move your waistline to my bassline
Heard it through the great vine, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
Bass, bass, bass, bass
This is my bassline, my bassline
Move, move your waistline to my bassline
Heard it through the great vine, my bassline
This is my bassline, my bassline
