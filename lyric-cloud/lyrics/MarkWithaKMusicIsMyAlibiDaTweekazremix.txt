I thought I told you before to turn that noise down
You're wasting your life with this garbage
Now turn it off (turn it off )

Take me as I am
Take my life, take my sin
Free me from everything
That I despise, I'm giving in
No faith in this life
Music is my alibi
Take me back where it began
The faith in me
The faith in me
From dusk 'til dawn
We grow strong
We stand and fight
Break free tonight
Take me 
Take me as I am
Take my life, take my sin
Free me from everything
That I despise, I'm giving in
No faith in this life
Music is my alibi
Take me back where it began
The faith in me
Ohhh
From dusk 'til dawn
Ohhh
We grow strong
Ohhh
We stand and fight
Ohhh
Break free tonight
The faith in me
We grow bigger every day and every night
We bring the noise
Fight!
You tell me with your lies
No escape, no disguise
Reaching to myself
Where I'm free, No one else
No fear, forget this life
Music is my alibi
Take me back where it began
The faith in me
In me
No fear, forget this life
Music is my alibi
Take me back where it began
The faith in me
Turn it up
Don't stop now
The faith in me
The faith in - turn it up
I thought I told you before to turn that noise down
You're wasting your life with this garbage
Now turn it off
