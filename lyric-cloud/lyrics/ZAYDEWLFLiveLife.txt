Sometimes I think that I'm the dreamer
The one that's standing all alone
Sometimes it feels like it's forever
Since I've truly felt at home

What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
To feel like freedom's mine
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
To feel like freedom's mine

Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad
Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad

Some nights I stay up staring at the stars
Wondering how far it goes
I know this life is all I have
That's what I've always been told

What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
Will you go where I go
The time is now not when
I'm reaching for your hand
Will you go where I go

Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad
Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad

Like it's the only one
Like it's the only one
Like it's the only one we got

Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad
Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad
Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad
Live life
Like I never have
Live life
Through the good and bad
