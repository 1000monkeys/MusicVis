Right

I remember when this all started, sex was carnage
This one's lasting, ah (ah ah), ah (ah ah)
I was, I was like, I was like cupid's calling, he's my darling
Things are gwanin, yeah

The, the only thing on my mind, all the time
No- on my mind, all the time
No- on my mind, all the time
No appetite
Always wanna bite, just my type, this one's mine
And there's never been a human being so good for me, oh

I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(all the time, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time)
If we're gonna do this, do it right
(all the time, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time)
If it's me and you, we gotta fight
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(oh, we gotta do it, oh, we gotta do it right)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right

The, the only thing on my mind, all the time
No- on my mind, all the time
No- on my mind, all the time
No appetite
Always wanna bite, just my type, this one's mine
And there's never been a human being so good for me

I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(all the time, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time)
If we're gonna do this, do it right
(all the time, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time)
If it's me and you, we gotta fight
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(oh, we gotta do it, oh, we gotta do it right)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it

The, the only thing on my mind, all the time
No- on my mind, all the time
No- on my mind, all the time
No appetite
Always wanna bite, just my type, this one's mine
And there's never been a human being so good for me

I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(all the time, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time)
If we're gonna do this, do it right
(all the time, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time, no- on my mind, all the time)
If it's me and you, we gotta fight
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
(oh, we gotta do it, oh, we gotta do it right)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right (right, right, right)
