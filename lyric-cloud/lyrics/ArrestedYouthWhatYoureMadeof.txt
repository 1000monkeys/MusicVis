I still act like I did back in the sixth grade
Shit stained, snotty nose, whiny little bitch face
Throwing temper tantrums in the bathroom
Toothpaste all over my switch blade
I wonder if I carved this grin into my skin
My life would be a joke then I'd feel better than I did
I wonder if I carved this grin into my skin
My life would be a joke

Yeah now I’m back (Oh oh oh oh)
Oh, look at that (Oh oh oh oh)
You're talking smack
I've been through hell but now I’m back

When death comes knocking at your door
And nothing's left worth fighting for
Say a little prayer and pull the rug
Show me what you're made of
Kingdom come is falling down
No one's left to save you now
Say a little prayer and pull the rug
Show me what you're made of

It's been 21 days since I played "The News"
CNN fucks with my brain and mood
There's only so much that a man can take
Thinking 'bout death in the office place
I stopped sending texts again
I wonder if I keep this up, will I still have friends ?
People get offended when I don’t reply
I feel relieved by the silence, but I don’t know why

Yeah now I'm back (Oh oh oh oh)
Oh, look at that (Oh oh oh oh)
You’re talking smack
I've been through hell but now I'm back

When death comes knocking at your door
And nothing's left worth fighting for
Say a little prayer and pull the rug
Show me what you’re made of
Kingdom come is falling down
No one's left to save you now
Say a little prayer and pull the rug
Show me what you're made of
Show me what you're made of

I walk alone, down the street
Don't need your prayer, no sympathy
I wear my pride, round my neck
So it's best you watch your steps
Cause I've been up, I've been down
I've been kicked out on the ground
But I stand tall where I'm at
Been to hell but now I'm back

When death comes knocking at your door
And nothing's left worth fighting for
Say a little prayer and pull the rug
Show me what you're made of
Kingdom come is falling down
No one's left to save you now
Say a little prayer and pull the rug
Show me what you're made of
Show me what you're made of
