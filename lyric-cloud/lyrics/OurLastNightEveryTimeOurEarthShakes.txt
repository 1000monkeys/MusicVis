Wave after wave, no change in my faith
I'm here for you through high or low
Every time our Earth shakes, I’ll fight through the pain
I'll die before I ever let you go

I made this promise to keep it
I won't let you slip away so easy
Even if it feels like we’re fading
It's gonna take a little more than the Earth shaking
So throw away the back up plans
Don't look back, just take my hand

Wave after wave, no change in my faith
I'm here for you through high or low
And every time our Earth shakes, I'll fight through the pain
I'll die before I ever let you go

I'll die before I
Before I ever let you go

Abandoned love keeps them drifting
But I won't jump ship even when it feels like it’s sinking
So throw away the backup plans (Just take my hand)

Wave after wave, no change in my faith
I’m here for you through high or low
And every time our Earth shakes, I'll fight through the pain
I’ll die before I ever let you go

I'll die before I
I'll die before I
I ever let you go

Surrounded by lonely, bruised, and broken love
I've seen it and I won’t be like everybody else

Wave after wave, no change in my faith (Change in my faith)
I'm here for you through high or low (Through high or low)
And every time our Earth shakes, I'll fight through the pain (Through the pain)
I'll die before I ever let you go (I'll never let you go)

I'll die
(I'll die before I let you go)
Before I
(I'll fight through the pain)
I'll die
(Every time our Earth shakes)
I'll die
I'll die before I ever let you go
