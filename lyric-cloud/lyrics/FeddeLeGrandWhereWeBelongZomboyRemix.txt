Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh

Into the great wide open
Pacing through the universe
Sailed across the darkness
Followed by years of silence

Here we are out in the open
Shooting stars without a home
Off in search of wisdom
High above fallen kingdoms

Hold me when the sun is down
'Till the morning light awakens
Shadows will be fading
Showing us where we belong

Showing us where we belong
Showing us where we be--

Into the great wide open
Cravin' for infinity
Hearts are set afire
Love's our one true desire

Here we are out in the open
Shooting stars without a home
Off in search of wisdom
High above fallen kingdoms

Hold me when the sun is down
Til the morning light awakens
Shadows will be fading
Showing us where we belong
Oh oh oh, oh

Showing us where we belong
Showing us where we be--
