Ah ah ah ah
Shaking all our lives
Oooooh
Guide me back once more
To yourself be true
Eurt eb dog fo naM
Nam a ma I, nam a ma I
Yoake kisetsu yume kibo
Umito hikariga youdeilu
Yes he told the truth (and he told the truth)
I love you for your silence
I love you for your peace (I love peace)
Sweep into my soul
Oooh - Slowly take control
Sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it
We are mortal
In the hands of gods who roll the dice
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknesses
