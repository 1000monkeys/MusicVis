I'm parading in your eyes
An open window never lies
If you take me for granted
You'll leave empty-handed

I'll forget you
I'll forget you

I'll forget you
-get you
Forget you
Never 

If you take me for granted
You'll leave empty-handed

If you- you- you-

I'll forget you

I'll forget you
-get you
Forget you
Never
