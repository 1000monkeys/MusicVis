When you feel like Indiana, Indiana Jones
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)
When they got you in a trap, dodging darts and boulders
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)
When you're on the ropes, on the ropes
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)
When they got you on the ropes, on the ropes
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)

You know you got to hang on, hang on
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on, hang on, yeah
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on and don't let go
Like Indiana Jones, you got to hang on, hang on
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on

When they throw you down a hole, snakes and scorpions
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)
When they got you in their evil grips with those ancient forces
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)
When you're on the ropes, on the ropes
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)
When they got you on the ropes, on the ropes
(Hey-oh hey, Hey-oh hey)

You know you got to hang on, hang on
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on, hang on, yeah
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on and don't let go
Like Indiana Jones, you got to hang on, hang on
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on
You know you got to hang on, hang on
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on, hang on, yeah
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on and don't let go
Like Indiana Jones, you got to hang on, hang on
Put your whole five fingers on, you got to hang on
