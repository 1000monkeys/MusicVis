Loose words and prepositions
Lead me to where you lie
Give me a proposition
And I’ll let you waste my time
Some shelter we’ve been given
From all the shit outside
So I’ll conjure up an image
Let it distract a while

Take me home and watch me give it up
Chase some young ideas that we’ve dreamt up

Constant crush
It's always got a hold on, hold on me
It's in my blood
Always got a hold on, hold on me

Under the complications
I'll keep closing my eyes
Lower my expectations
So I can sleep at night

Take me home and watch me give you up
Chase some idealism I dreamt up

Constant crush
It's always got a hold on, hold on me
It's in my blood
Always got a hold on, hold on me

Take me home and watch me give you up
Chase some idealism I dreamt up

Constant crush
It's always got a hold on, hold on me
It's in my blood
Always got a hold on, hold on me
