I'm a critic to any critic whose a net geek
Dead emcees that wreck beats like dancers with two left feet
I got balls and i got bars, you can't test these
Leave you comatose for seven days when they knock you into next week //
Emcees tempt me but the car parks dead g
I'm using dark arts leaving half hearts dead meat
Till they spill their milk crying with a glass half empty
Then i 'turn the other cheek' to them 'half arsed emcees' //
Smoke long spliffs, strong piff and mong quick
So it's a wrap for the rest of the day when i got piff
I'm on this next to me them emcees should not spit
Talking something bob bout 'prescence' when they got the wrong gift //
You can go to the gym, but sniff will have ya dropping weight
And before you know it you've got slim like Dr Dre
The morning after looking like you've started to rot away
Acting gangster when in fact you're proper gay like ronnie kray //
Still speed up dubs when i need a rush
Your fillers cheesy stuff so i eat them up like pizza crust
Handsome devil with the meanest tongue, turn twisted
Sinister sadistic evil cunt like beezlebub //
Alive in the minds of heads that wish i was dead
But what keeps me going is knowing that i'm pissing off heads
Your not a monster on this thing you're just a myth like loch ness
With such a bitchy complex i bet you sit with crossed legs //
Fresh flows that make haters want to head home
Who have an answer for everything yet never want a test though
Lethal inject the set when i get close
To audiences that don't want to hear it when i kill it, but eff a death/deaf row //
Parry stance hands apart like van der sar
Don't think your fans are hard i'll fly kick that shit like cantona
They want to try a sneaky one like a random pass
But i don't have a bar like playing footie with jumpers at the park //
Switch the script i don't need respect
Split personalities that DP skets on a greedy flex
They want to use me for their measly rep
But them channels are so americanized we only see b.s / c.b.s //
Working on an album and i hope you like it
If not wasteman get slapped with same hand i wrote the rhymes with
I'm only joking i'm not known for violence
I just spit that type of shit for the open minded
