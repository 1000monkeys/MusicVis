Well I see you, so I got you
Running your mouth like the words you spit make you
You think your best is better than mine
You think your best is better than mine
Well I got you, now I own you
The look in your eyes, the fear betrays you
You think your best is better than mine
Son, nobody's best is better than mine
All my life leading up to this moment
All my life chasing these dreams
Well I got you, now I own you
Nobody's best is better than mine
Fist in the dirt, yeah this is gonna hurt
This is my time, gonna lay it on the line
All my life leading up to this moment
Hit the lights, showtime, it's my time...
Your weakness, my strength
A strength of name and a strength of number
You think your best is better than mine
You think your best is better than mine
When I'm under, I'll roll you over
When I'm over you know I'll smash you under
You think your best is better than mine
Son, nobody's best is better than mine
All my life leading up to this moment
All my life chasing these dreams
Well I got you, now I own you
Nobody's best is better than mine
Fist in the dirt, yeah this is gonna hurt
This is my time, gonna lay it on the line
All my life leading up to this moment
Hit the lights, showtime, it's my time...
Fist in the dirt, yeah this is gonna hurt
This is my time, gonna lay it on the line
All my life leading up to this moment
Hit the lights, showtime, it's my time...
It's my time, it's my time
At my worst I'm better than you
At my worst I'm better than you
At my worst I'm better than you
At my worst I'm better than you
Nobody's best is better than mine
At my worst I'm better than you
At my worst I'm better than you
At my worst I'm better than you
Nobody's best is better than mine
Fist in the dirt, yeah this is gonna hurt
This is my time, gonna lay it on the line
All my life leading up to this moment
Hit the lights, showtime, it's my time...
Fist in the dirt, yeah this is gonna hurt
This is my time, gonna lay it on the line
All my life leading up to this moment
Hit the lights, showtime, it's my time...
It's my time, it's my time
Nobody's best is better than mine
