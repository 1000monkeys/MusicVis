Yeah, I saw a demon in the mirror
Hates in my heart I can see it now it’s clear
Feel it in the air, see it in the way that I’m speaking to my peers
I can see this shit is weird, they’re aware that I’m tired
Fueled by a lie, wasting all my time on the people i despise
Vengeance on my mind, they don’t know the half
And the funny thing about it is that i’ve been holding back
That’s just crazy me, why can’t I just let it be
It’s time for me to let it slide, I always gotta say my piece
Don’t know where I’m headed now, hope I didn’t let you down
Fake it ’til you make it baby, never show a shred of doubt
Get up there and do your thing, show them that you’re settled down
Fly like you were made to soar, either wait or never win
Let them know I said it, make them live to regret it
It’s all that I ever wanted, I think I’m starting to get it
God damn

Somebody told me in this life there ain't shit that’s free
If you wanna go get that, I’ll never forget that
I’m kicking down the devil’s door
Somebody told me in this life there ain't shit that’s free
If you wanna go get that, I’ll never forget that
I’m kicking down the devil’s door

As soon as I heard the beat it turned into something deep
All that I’m holding close, is seeming harder to keep
Seeming harder to hold, I see them walking the road
It's Like everyone that I love is falling off of the globe
Gotta move it along, gotta keep up the pace
Gotta serve up a meal and not just give them a taste
Resting this on my faith, my shoulders could take the weight
There’s something that’s on your mind, that’s something you oughta say
Why would I let ‘em down, or why would I break the trust
I’m trying to clean up the mess since I’ve been left in the dust
Sitting off to the side there's something more to desire
Waiting out in the cold will put you over the fire
No room for the weak, no hope for the sheep
Just starting to see there’s somewhere I gotta be
No time to relax, or reminiscing the past
I think they're counting me out, well tell them all that I’m back
Ol boy

Somebody told me in this life there ain't shit that’s free
If you wanna go get that, I’ll never forget that
I’m kicking down the devil’s door
Somebody told me in this life there ain't shit that’s free
If you wanna go get that, I’ll never forget that
I’m kicking down the devil’s door

That’s why you gotta become it
Cus they don’t care that you want it
And they assuming you nothing
I gotta get ‘em to love it
I turn the dial on the oven to let them know that I’m coming
This what I’m going for, going to war
They can lock me out but I’m kicking down the fucking door
I go for more, I take it all rich or poor
There’s no remorse, I’m getting lost forgive me lord
Certain I'll get it, only to playing to win it
Between my focus and my vision, don’t believe in the limit
See the way that I’m living, all my windows are tinted
See the way that I get it, I’ll be back in a minute
Thinking of all the struggle, I turned it into a hustle
Time to bury my doubts, someone get me a shovel
Someone gave me a thought, I turned it into a game
Found a way I could win, the only way I could play
(Lets go)

Somebody told me in this life there ain't shit that’s free
If you wanna go get that, I’ll never forget that
I’m kicking down the devil’s door
Somebody told me in this life there ain't shit that’s free
If you wanna go get that, I’ll never forget that
I’m kicking down the devil’s door
