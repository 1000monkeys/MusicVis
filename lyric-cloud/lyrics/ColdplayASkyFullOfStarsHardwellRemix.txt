Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm going to give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
And cause you light up the path

I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

So sky
You're a sky full of stars
Such heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
