I was scared of change
Knowing nothing would be the same
Stressed and overwhelmed, I began to cave
My mind was spinning in circles, so out of control
I closed my eyes and hoped for acceptance

Anxious and barely breathing
Watching my life turn inside out (Turn inside out)
Nervous, my hands were shaking
Everything was slowly fading away
But I'll be okay
I'll be okay

The clouds roll over the hills
And the sun begins to shine
I say goodbye to the worried ghost that was trapped inside
Set me free from the darkness that covered me

Anxious and barely breathing
Watching my life turn inside out (Turn inside out)
Nervous, my hands were shaking
Everything was slowly fading away
But I'll be okay

My life may change
But it won't change me, it won't change me
'Cause I'm always gonna be who I wanna be
I can feel the pages burning
Faster than the wheels are turning
But my head stays high
My life may change
But it won't change me, it won't change me
'Cause I'm always gonna be who I wanna be
I can feel the pages burning
Faster than the wheels are turning
But my head stays high

Anxious and barely breathing
Watching my life turn inside out (Turn inside out)
Nervous, my hands were shaking
Everything was slowly fading away
But I'll be okay

My life may change
But it won't change me, it won't change me
'Cause I'm always gonna be who I wanna be
I can feel the pages burning
Faster than the wheels are turning
But my head stays high
