I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dicted to you
I'm addic-dic-dicted
You're addicted to me
So ridiculously
I'm addic-dic-dicted to you
I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dicted to you
You're addic-dic-dicted to me
I'm a slave for your kicks
Come and give me a fix
I'm addic-dic-dicted to you

Cocaine can't do it like you do it to me
My brains can't take it when you push it on me
And I stick like glue when I'm sniffing you, ah

I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dicted to you
I'm addic-dic-dicted
You're addicted to me
So ridiculously
I'm addic-dic-dicted to you
I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dicted to you
You're addic-dic-dicted to me
I'm a slave for your kicks
Come and give me a fix
I'm addic-dic-dicted to you

Cocaine can't do it like you do it to me
My brains can't take it when you push it on me
And I stick like glue when I'm sniffing you, ah
I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dic-dic-dic (fool)

'Cause I'll always be a sucker for your dress
And I will always be a sucker for your meth
So what are we?
You and me
She said baby save me
You could be the hero in me

I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dicted to you
I'm addic-dic-dicted
You're addicted to me
So ridiculously
I'm addic-dic-dicted to you
I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dicted to you
You're addic-dic-dicted to me
I'm a slave for your kicks
Come and give me a fix
I'm addic-dic-dicted to you

Cocaine can't do it like you do it to me
My brains can't take it when you push it on me
And I stick like glue when I'm sniffing you, ah
I'm addic-dic-dic-dic-dic-dic-dic (fool)

'Cause I'll always be a sucker for your dress
And I will always be a sucker for your meth
So what are we?
You and me
What are we?
You and me
What are we?
What are we?
She said baby save me
