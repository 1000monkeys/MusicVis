I don't really want to do this anymore
It's time to watch it burn
Throw it into the flames until it turns
Blacker than that heart you tried to give me from the start
Higher than you must have been to let us fall apart
It's time to watch it burn
Watch it burn
It's time to watch it burn
Watch it burn
Time to watch it burn
I don't want to do this anymore
Don't let us fall apart
No no no-o
I don't want to do this anymore
Don't let us fall apart
No no no-o
It's time to watch it burn
Watch it burn
Gonna watch it burn, yeah
Watch it burn
Time to watch it burn
Yeah, yeah, watch it burn
Watch it burn
It's time to watch it burn
