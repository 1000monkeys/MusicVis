I'm waking up
I'm looking at the future
I see a storm
It's got the sky painted black
Covered in rust
Is this the revolution?
Do you hear the heart beating?

I had a dream
I was rising from the fallout
I'm building steam
It's all been coming down to this
Man or machine
I am the evolution
Do you hear the heart beating?

Waking up
Waking up the animal
Waking up
Waking up

I've got that lightening in my veins
I'm feeling something I can't explain
Waking up the animal
Waking up
I've got this power living inside
It has no mercy
You cannot hide
Waking up the animal
Waking up
The animal

I never thought
I'd be standing with the mountains
I never thought
I'd be hanging on the razor edge
Get to the top
That's all I ever wanted

Do you hear the heart beating?
Can you hear the heart beating?

Waking up
Waking up
Waking up the animal
Waking up
Waking up
Waking up the animal

I've got that lightening in my veins
I'm feeling something I can't explain
Waking up the animal
Waking up
I've got this power living inside
It has no mercy
You cannot hide
Waking up the animal
Waking up
The animal

Something so savage
Gotta take it gotta have it
More than we imagined
Something so savage
Something so savage
Gotta take it gotta have it
More than we imagined
Something so savage (Waking up)

I've got that lightening in my veins
I'm feeling something I can't explain
Waking up the animal
Waking up
I've got this power living inside
It has no mercy
You cannot hide
Waking up the animal
Waking up
The animal

Yep
Waking up the animal
