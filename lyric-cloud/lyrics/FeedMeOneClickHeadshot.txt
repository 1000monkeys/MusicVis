We are all evil, and it's beautiful
We are all evil, and it's so beautiful
We are all evil, and it's beautiful
We are all evil, and it's so beautiful

I can dance all day, I can dance all day
Try hit me, try hit me, c'mon!
I mean my heart's beating, my heart's beating
My hands are shaking, my hands are shaking
But I'm still shooting, and I'm still getting them headshots like
Boom headshot, boom headshot, boom headshot!

We are all evil, and it's beautiful
We are all evil, and it's so beautiful

We are all evil, and it's so beautiful
We are all evil, and it's beautiful
We are all evil, and it's so beautiful
We are all evil, and it's beautiful
We are all evil, and it's so beautiful

I can dance all day, I can dance all day
Try hit me, try hit me, c'mon!
I mean my heart's beating, my heart's beating
My hands are shaking, my hands are shaking
But I'm still shooting, and I'm still get them headshots like
Boom headshot, boom headshot, boom headshot!
