And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

I jump off from an airplane
To see if I can fly
I lit a house on fire
Just to see a painted sky
Did you know, did you know?
I've been running all my life

Sometimes I say you're crazy
Sometimes I'll think you're strange
Maybe you're the one who found a way out of this cage
Here we go, here we go
Let's go take apart this night

And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on

And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

I walk the lines they made me
Just to make them smile
'Cause every monster they make
Was once a happy child
Did you know, did you know?
We won't go with out a fight

They said that you'd be nothing
They said these dreams will die
But I stood strong and worked too hard to keep this hope alive
Here we go, here we go
I'm going to write my name in lights

And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on

And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

When I go, I'll go as you'll never know
When I go, I'll go as you'll never know
I can feel the mountain's burning sun
When I go, I'll go as you'll never know
When I go, I'll go as you'll never know
I can feel the mountain's burning sun

And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost
Living in my head
And there's a hope, hope, hope
Burning my bed
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild

I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild
I'm young and wild
