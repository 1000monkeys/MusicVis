Pale yellow
Release the drain and let the fluid go
Just make the liquor flow
Pale yellow
As my heart races, I wanted you to know
I will rise again, slow

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I will fix the pain on my own
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone

Pale yellow
Unrip the flesh and let the damage grow
Like a blade in the chest bones
Pale yellow
Relieve the weight and give it a last go
And make it your best shot

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I will fix the pain on my own
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I will fix the pain on my own
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I will fix the pain on my own
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My love for you will be gone
