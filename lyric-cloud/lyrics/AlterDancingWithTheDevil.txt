I'm tossing in bed
Can’t sleep in basements
Live in the wasteland
Below
It's all in our head
Fear and frustrations
Chest pain sensations
I know
Tyna isolate
Send us out of space
Now I found another level
No I'm not a saint
Payin’ my mistakes
All the angels wait
But I'm dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil
I'm tossing in bed
Feeling I'm vacant
Anger misplaced in
My soul
Hung from the thread
Clearly temptation
Not been a secret
Below
Find a quiet place
Plotting my escape
With the gas up on the pedal
No I'm not a saint
Payin' my mistakes
All the angels wait
But I'm dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil
Drivin like 205
Just to know I'm alive
I’m terrified (terrified)
Drivin like 205
Just to know I’ll survive
I'm terrified (terrified)
I’m terrified
I'm terrified
Ya
I'm paralyzed
I'm terrified
I’m scared to die
I'm scared to die
Dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil
