I got you to myself
Keeping it on the down low
My lips will never tell
I’ll go where you want me to go

I know you’re far away but that’s nothing new…
(That’s nothing new)
So I’ll imagine lying right next to you…
(Right next to you)
Baby you’re not in my dreams
But I’m thinking about the things you do to me
And I know I’m not alone
You’re not in my dreams
But I’m thinking about the things you do to me
And I know I’m not alone

I know you know me well
Told you that it’s been too long
But God how your body felt
But I feel you turning me on

I know you’re far away but that’s nothing new…
(That’s nothing new)
So I’ll imagine lying right next to you…
(Right next to you)
Baby you’re not in my dreams
But I’m thinking about the things you do to me
And I know I’m not alone
You’re not in my dreams
But I’m thinking about the things you do to me
And I know I’m not alone
