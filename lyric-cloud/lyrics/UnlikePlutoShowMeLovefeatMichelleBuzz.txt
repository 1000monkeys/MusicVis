We used to fuel the flip
We used to sail that tide away
And Iâ€”
Now I'm only hearing static on our station
Don't leave me alone this way

Night after night
Day after day
I want you coursin' through my veins
Night after night
Day after day
I've only one lil' course to make

Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love

We used to get so high (love love)
Out of this world and past the sky
Now I'm sleded
I feel like a one-man nation
Don't leave me alone to die (mm-I-oh)

Night after night
Day after day
I want you coursin' through my veins
Night after night
Day after day
I've only one lil' course to make

Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love

Love love love (whatever)
Mmm-no (no)
Ahh

Night after night
Day after day
I feel you coursin' through my veins
Night after night
Day after day
I've only one lil' course to make

Love love love love
Show me love
Love love love love
Show me love
Show me love
(Oh we should say) Show me love

Love love love love
Yeah-ah
Love love love love
Yeah-ah
