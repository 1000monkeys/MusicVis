Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know

When I was young, my mother said
There is a savage that is hiding in your head
I felt rebellion, I came alive
When I embrace the reckless one that's deep inside
Time won't change a man, but the wild will

Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know
Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know

Step on out to the wilderness
Let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Step on out to the wilderness
Let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah we are the wildest ones

Don't be afraid, don't be alarmed
It's just the animal inside you growing strong
Don't try to hide it, just let it out
It's just the wilderness you've always heard about
Time won't change a man, but the wild will

Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know
Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know

Step on out to the wilderness
Let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Step on out to the wilderness
Let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah we are the wildest ones

When I was young, my mother said
There is a savage that is hiding in your head

Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know
Yeah we are the wildest ones
Yeah we're just the ones that you know, you know

Step on out to the wilderness
Let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Step on out to the wilderness
Let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
Yeah, let's be wild
