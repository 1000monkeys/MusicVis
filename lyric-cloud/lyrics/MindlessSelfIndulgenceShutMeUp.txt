The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a second

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

Oooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la
Oooh

The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a second

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)
I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)
Because the break, the break, the break

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
