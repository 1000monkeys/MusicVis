I love you baby
Who will i have to be
For you to be the one
So we can start a fire
Until the day comes
I'll be waiting here
If it takes forever
I will look to see
What lies ahead of me
Oh baby when i hear your voice
You leaving me breathless
You've giving me no other choice
So baby i must let you know
I'm keeping my heart for later
I'm keeping my soul alive
And i will wait a lifetime
Until it's you and i
I'm keeping my heart for later
Keeping my soul alive
And i will wait a lifetime
Until it's you and i
Anywhere you wonder
Anywhere you go
I promiss i will stay
Boy i love you so
There will be a time
When all the waiting is done
And doubts will disappear
They will be one by one
Oh baby when i hear your voice
You leaving me breathless
You've giving me no other choice
So baby i must let you know
I'm keeping my heart for later
I'm keeping my soul alive
And i will wait a lifetime
Until it's you and i
I'm keeping my heart for later
Keeping my soul alive
And i will wait a lifetime
Until it's you and i
Keeping my heart for later
Keeping my heart for later
You and i....
Do you feel me baby
You feel me baby
I'm keeping my heart for later
Keeping my soul alive
And i will wait a lifetime
Until it's you and i
I'm keeping my heart for later
Keeping my soul alive
And i will wait a lifetime
Until it's you and i
Until it's you and i
Until it's you and i
