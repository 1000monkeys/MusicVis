Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die (oo-oh)
[Verse 1: Chrissy Costanza, 
Ma
ko
, 
Both
]
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
[Chorus: Both, 
Chrissy Costanza
]
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die...
[Verse 2: Chrissy Costanza, 
Mako
]
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs â€“ the scars collected all their lives (oo-oh)
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Woah
, pick yourself up 'cause
[Chorus: Both, 
Chrissy Costanza
]
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die...
[Bridge: Mako, 
Chrissy Costanza
, 
Both
]
Woah, when the world is callin' out your name, 
begging you to fight
Oh, 
pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up 'cause
[Chorus: Both, 
Chrissy Costanza
]
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh)
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Legends never die (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Legends never die...
