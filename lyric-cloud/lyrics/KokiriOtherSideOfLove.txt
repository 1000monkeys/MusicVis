Yeah

I grew cold waiting for your arms to hold me
Days grew long, never knew the nights could feel so lonely

But now the tables are turning to watch and learn
The fire we had it no longer burns
And finally I know to you I don't belong

So this is what it feels like
Now I'm on the other side
Now I've rid my tears dry
Glad I'm on the other side, the other side of love

Glad I'm on the other side, the other side of love
The other side
The other side of love

I let go
Now I've found a better place without you
Where I belong
In a peace I hope your finding yours too

The tables are turning to watch and learn
The fire we had it no longer burns
And finally I know to you I don't belong

So this is what it feels like
Now I'm on the other side
Now I've rid my tears dry
Glad I'm on the other side
So this is what it feels like
Now I'm on the other side of love
And now I've built my paradise
Glad I'm on the other side, the other side of love

Glad I'm on the other side
Now I've built my paradise
The other side
The other side of love

Now I've built my paradise
Glad I'm on the other side, the other side of love
The other side
The other side of love
Oh
Yeah
Now I'm on the other side, the other side
