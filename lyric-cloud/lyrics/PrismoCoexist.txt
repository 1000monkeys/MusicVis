A Biological hominid mutation, anatomical straits of ocean dwellers
Aquatic primordial effigy, failed to Coexist with mankind
Mereka Nyata, Mereka Nyata
Mereka nyata, Mereka nyata
Mereka nyata, mereka nyata
Mereka Nyata, mereka nyata
Evolutionary existence of modern primal being
Scenic divergence separating colonies afar
Adaptation of aquatic existence, hydrophilic habitation, rearranged its membrane structures
Cranium deformation, wearing its crests as crowns
Wandering kings of the abyss
Floating with its gracious divine
Natural selection constructed the conquering species
Limb by limbs it evolved to an epithelium of squamous layer
Trapped, in a vortex of aquatic prison they call a shelter
Hiding away from humanity where homosapien scum eradicated such majestic creation even at depths of pitch blackness
All down to the ground
Hunted down to near extinction
Followed by creation of fiction
A dark truth covered by false history
And stowed away
Pesan mereka tak terbaca
Semua hilang tak terbaca
Beware of the unknown trenches
Where these creatures breed
Equipped with a desire for vengeance
To eradicate terrestrial life forms
Mereka Nyata, Mereka Nyata
Mereka nyata, Mereka nyata
Mereka nyata, mereka nyata
Mereka Nyata, mereka nyata
