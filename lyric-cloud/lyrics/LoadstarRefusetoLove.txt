I don't like words anymore
Cause you don't hear me
And I've used them all before
I keep my head up
But I still notice the floor
No, I won't do this anymore

Refuse to love, refuse to learn
Fuel the fire and watch it burn
Always tried, truth or lies, it always hurts
I'll never make the same mistake
You've had your turn
Now I'm gonna watch you learn
Now I'm gonna watch you learn
