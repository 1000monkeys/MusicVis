See you as you are
Villan in your veins
Why you gotta show disdain
Gang of a hundred useless pawns
I'm all right
Fly as paper planes
We will never let you reign
Bang out my drum line 'till the dawn

I see you standing still
Out in the open
I know my opponents know the deal
Lined up for miles
We'll take you on
Don't give a damn how you feel
We're ready, been running all day
Said there's no need to delay
Lower your guns
Move out the way
I'll say, I'll say

Yeah, why don't we fight them all
Why don't we stand tall
'Cause I can take them one by two
You got me, I got you
Let's fight them all

Yeah, this is our fight song, fight song
This is our fight song, fight song
'Cause I can take them one by two
You got me, I got you
Let's fight them all

Cock out my gun
Let it start blazing, yeah
Turn my head left to right
They run like hell is raising, yeah
Locate these bandits on the run
They try to steal my style
They got no taste for us
We lean back smooth and deal a smile
Bang out my drum line 'till the dawn
These thieves surround
They pulling us down
Weapons firing off
But they never heard my sound
Why you up in arms
Tell me who's to blame
If we can't compromise
Load your guns don't walk away

Yeah, why don't we fight them all
Why don't we stand tall
'Cause I can take them one by two
You got me, I got you
Let's fight them all

Yeah, this is our fight song, fight song
This is our fight song, fight song
'Cause I can take them one by two
You got me, I got you
Let's fight them all

Said don't bite your tongue
Open from the start
I said, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave you as you are
You got m-my heart
I said, no, no, no, no, no, no
Said don't bite your tongue
Open from the start
I said, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave you as you are
You got m-my heart
I said, no, no, no, no, no, no
