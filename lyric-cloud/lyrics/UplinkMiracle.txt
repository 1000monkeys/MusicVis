Embrace your destiny
Slay your enemy
Raise a legacy
No more apologies
Trust your abilities
Gather the energies
Pull yourself back together
Been staying off track forever
Child of the nation
Go seek redemtpion
Time for salvation
Today is mean to be
Day of victory
Time for history
Reverse the tendency
Fight the entropy
Channel your rivalry
You're praying for fortune to come
You're hearing the sound of the drums
It's too late to backtrack
Go pack your bag now
Keep your feet on the ground
And stand up
You've got what it takes
To fight back
Don't stop
Until you black out
Out, out, out
Stand up, up
You've got what it takes
To fight back, back
Don't stop until you
Black out
Out, out, out
Give all you've got and
Show them how to make a miracle
Stand up
Up,up
You've got what it takes to
Fight back,back
Don't stop until you
Black out, out
Give all you've got and
Show them how to make a mriacle
Go save your team, be a hero
Take home the cup, be a star
They're waiting for you, take aim
Shoot your arrow
It's your time to shine, show them who you are
Stronger
Gotta go faster
Gotta get better
Gotta work harder
It's fight or flight now
Get in, get out now
Go break the mould
Go for the gold
Lit up the stadium, you know how it's done
Stand up, up
You've got what it takes
To fight back, back
Don't stop until you
Black out,out
Give all you've got and
Show them how to make a miracle
Stand up, up
You've got what it takes
To fight back, back
Don't stop until you
Black out,out
Give all you've got and
Show them how to make a miracle
Stand up, up
You've got what it takes
To fight back
Don't stop until you
Black out,out
Give all you've got and
Show them how to make a miracle
Stand up, up
You've got what it takes
To fight back,back
Don't stop until you
Black out,out
