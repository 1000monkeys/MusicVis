Wake up, make a fuss, and spill your guts for me
Get started, smear your heart on a dirty sleeve

Ooh, you better savor those golden days
You never can tell when your luck will change, ayy
This time, get it right or you're history

Eat your heart out, we won't stop now
Bleeding our blood on the drums
Sinkin' our teeth in the heart of the sun
Simple creatures, busted speakers
Bleeding our blood on the drums
Sinkin' our teeth in the heart of the sun

Whoo, singin' out, oh-oh-oh!

Hey, now, don't get caught up in the politics
Make good with the cool kids but don't be a hypocrite

Ooh, You better savor those golden days
Youâ€™re never gonna know when your luck will change, aye
This time, get it right or you're history

Eat your heart out, we won't stop now
Bleeding our blood on the drums
Sinkin' our teeth in the heart of the sun
Simple creatures, busted speakers
Bleeding our blood on the drums
Sinkin' our teeth in the heart of the sun

Whoo, singin' out, oh-oh-oh!

Yeah, don't give up, darlin'
Don't give up, don't give up, darlin'
What eludes you now will come to you in time
Ooh

Eat your heart out, we won't stop now
Bleeding our blood on the drums
Sinkin' our teeth in the heart of the sun
Simple creatures, busted speakers
Bleeding our blood on the drums
Sinkin' our teeth in the heart of the sun

Whoo, singin' out, oh-oh-oh!
