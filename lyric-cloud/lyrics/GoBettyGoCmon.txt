Next week came so suddenly
I tried to see the ways, that I have changed
I tried to tell you everything
I guess time wasn't right, and now it's just too late
Come on, come on
It's not what I said
Believe, believe
What I meant
All my friends have come and gone
It's like my past erased, and traveled into space
I'm logically all confused
And turning to you was, my best solution
Come on, come on
It's not what I said (not what I said)
Believe, believe
What I meant (what I meant)
Ease up, ease up
And life will get better (life will get better)
Enjoy, enjoy
It's all there
Today I've come to choose my ways
I've seen it all before
I thought it wasn't so
The truth will always hurt
Even when it's not intended to be that way
That way
ONE, TWO, BETTY GO!!
Come on, come on
It's not what I said
Believe, believe
What I meant
Ease up, ease up
And life will get better
Enjoy, enjoy
It's all there
Come on, come on
It's not what I said (not what I said)
Believe, believe
What I meant (what I meant)
Ease up, ease up
And life will get better (life will get better)
Enjoy, enjoy
It's all there
With all the things that I've thrown in your face
And only caused you pain
I've got to go now
It doesn't make much sense, it's all that I've got left
It's all that I've got left
