Say what you wanna say
If it means you gonna stay
Show me another way
I know it will save the day
Moments have gone away
I float on air today
I land on the floor and pray
That I'll be walking on fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey

Say what you wanna say
If it means you gonna stay
Show me another way
I know it will save the day
Moments have gone away
I float on air today
I land on the floor and pray
That I'll be walking on fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
That I'll be walking on
That I'll be walking on
That I'll be walking on

Pray if you gonna pray
If it helps you sleep okay
Show me a hidden way
I know it will save the day
Moments have gone away
I float on air today
I land on the floor and pray
That I'll be walking on fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
Fields of grey
That I'll be walking on
That I'll be walking on
