Looking through the dark for the answers
As we search for the cause to our cancer
It spreads through our minds like a plague
Looking up at the stars hoping there is something more
It terrifies us to feel a termination of our consciousness

The mystery continues
Hundreds of feet below the ground
A treasure that cannot be found

Three men lie dead at the bottom
Questions took their lives as they tried to solve them
Ending your search for the truth
'X' marks the spot of the past that can't be caught
Where the secrets are kept, stories are left
And the safe stays locked

The mystery continues
Hundreds of feet below the ground
A treasure that cannot be found
Could it be our true history?
Unsolved and undecided
Buried deep beneath an island

This world might not be yours to keep
Fight for it, fight for it
The answer could be right beneath our feet
Fight for it, fight for it

The mystery continues
Hundreds of feet below the ground
A treasure that cannot be found
Could it be our true history?
Unsolved and undecided
Buried deep beneath an island
