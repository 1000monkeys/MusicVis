Take you for a ride, take you for a ride out there
Waited in line all of this time
And you can step inside
And I can step inside
And there's nowhere you can hide
There's nowhere I can hide
We said we'd make a deal
Said we'd make a deal out there
Is what you said
Is what you said
Just tell me all your lies such a thin disguise
We fooled ourselves, we fooled ourselves
Anything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
You said you started to believe that it was always so
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
Everything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
You said you started to believe that it was always so
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
Anything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
You said you started to believe that it was always so
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
Everything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
You said you started to believe that it was always so
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
Anything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
You said you started to believe that it was always so
Ain't it always so? Ain't it always so?
