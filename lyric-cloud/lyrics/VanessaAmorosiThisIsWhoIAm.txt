I spend my life, trying to do things right
But all I do is fall to my face
With my hands on my head so many times
But then I learnt, after being burnt
To get back up and push straight on
Stop the tears people move on, on
Well it’s alright to be myself
Now I’ve learnt to stand
Well it’s ok to be just who I am
I spent years really hating me
Longing to be friends, now I hope that you can understand
This is who I am
Now when life gets tough
I’m quick to hurry up
I run all day, I run through the night
I break down walls, I hit up high
I don’t care if I’m fat, or if you think my clothes are bad
‘Cos I can go to sleep at night, I’m a good person and I’ll get by
Well It’s alright to be myself
Now I’ve learnt to stand
Well it’s ok to be just who I am
I spent years really hating me
Longing to be friends, now I hope that you can understand
This is who I am
Are you someone, are you someone
Are you someone, someone like me
You deserve, you deserve, you deserve to be free
Cause the world will keep spinning, and you’ll be trapped in it
Well it’s alright to be myself
Now I’ve learnt to stand
Well it’s ok to be just who I am
I’ve spent years really hating me
Longing to be friends, now I hope that you can understand
This is who I am
