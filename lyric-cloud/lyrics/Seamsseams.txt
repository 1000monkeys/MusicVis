All of the thread that
I used to tie us
Is coming apart
Is coming apart
All of the colors
The colors, that I used
They turned dark
They turned dark
And I don't even know
Why I've been feeling so low
But I head for the fire
When I got no place to go
All of the thread that
I used to tie us
Is coming apart
Is coming apart

I don't understand what's happening, baby
You're breaking my heart
I don't even know how to talk to you lately
We're falling apart...

At the See-aa-eeams
At the See-aa-eeams

At the-

All of the things
That were keeping us warmer
They don't work, no
They don't work
Out in the cold, now
I can't even see you
Oh god, this hurts
It really hurts
And I don't even know
Why I've been feeling so low
But I head for the fire
When I got no place to go
All of the things
That were keeping us warmer
They don't work, no
They don't work

I don't understand what's happening, baby
You're breaking my heart
I don't even know how to talk to you lately
We're falling apart...

We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart...
