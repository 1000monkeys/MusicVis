Starlight raining over me
Like drifting through a memory
Wake up in your crystal sky
We're floating just to feel alive
Starlight raining over me
Like drifting through a memory
Wake up in your crystal sky
We're floating till we fly

We're slowly falling through the night
Illuminating coastlines
Headlights toward the afterlife
Bright enough to shine
Colors fade into the waves
Swimming through reality
I see your eyes above it all
I can hear you call

Starlight raining over me
Like drifting through a memory
Wake up in your crystal sky
We're floating till we fly
